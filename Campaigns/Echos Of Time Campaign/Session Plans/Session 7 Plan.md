Bioluminescent bloom for 3 days. Slightly foggy and chilly.

Valentine and Naula get a job to find a missing cat. The missing cat turns into a family of missing cats. Paid 15 gold and Naula carves Jobies name into his collar.

Darrow and Twig go to try to talk to the wisps. The wisps turn out to be the missing cat. They are paid with 12 gold and 2 odd shaped coins that are very dirty. Magic can be felt from them.

Byrn told the group and the Orc guard that the people that hurt him at the grove were much taller and one had large wings.
