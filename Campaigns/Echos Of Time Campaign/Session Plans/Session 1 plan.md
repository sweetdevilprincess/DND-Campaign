### [[Darrow]]
You are working late in the library organizing texts and gathering books for [[Seraphiel]]. The night is quiet, most other assistants and students having retired for the evening.
You are walking back to [[Seraphiel]] 's quarters where the door is left slightly ajar. You can hear arguing between [[Seraphiel]] and another Aasimar. **Roll Stealth**

Seraphiel: "Lower your voice Zeph. The walls have ears, even at this hour."

Zeph: "I don't care who hears. This is madness, Seraphiel. Using an outsider for such a delicate task? Have you lost your mind?"

Seraphiel: "On the contrary, it's the perfect cover. Darrow's naivety and thirst for knowledge make him ideal. He's been combing through the library, gathering every scrap of information about Etherium and Aetheria without even realizing the significance."

Zeph: "And what happens when he does realize?"

Seraphiel: "By then, it will be too late. We'll have all the information we need to locate and destroy any remnants of Etherium. The boy's curiosity and his want to please is leading us straight to it."

Zeph: "The others will never approve of this."

Seraphiel: "The rest will thank up when we deal with Etherium. Besides, we've already been hearing rumors that someone has found the ruins. All we need to do now is get confirm them and send our own people to purge the site."

Zeph: "And the boy?"

Seraphiel: "Once his usefulness ends, so does his access to our halls. I will just pass him off, tell him that he has done well and that his services are no longer needed and he'll be none the wiser."

Zeph: "I do hope you know what you are doing Seraphiel. If this backfires..."

Seraphiel: "It won't."

What do you do? You remember that you heard a rumor of some sort mentioning [[Etherium]] and that your parents scroll mentioned something of Etherium as well. 
You leave [[Sunspire Citadel]], using the excuse that Seraphiel had you running errands. You make your way to Glimmershade, the only town that leads you from Lumina to the Whisapering Vale.


### [[Campaigns/Echos Of Time Campaign/Player Specific/Stella/Stella]]
You make your way through the woods, the last few years an uncomfortable blur for you. You spent every moment in the forest, learning form it and letting it teach you. You've been trying to push the loss of your grandparents from your mind, not necessarily grieving from the loss, but rather trying your hardest to prove that you are as skilled of a witch that they believed you to be. After finding them, you knew that you had to find your brother, your only family left. 
When you return to where you left him, he was gone. He had already ran, and you had no idea where he had gone to, you just knew in your heart that you would find him again. You flit through the familiar woods, listening to the sounds of the forest. **Roll Perception** *Auto Fail* 
Jump to [[#Valentine]].
Until you hear the sounds of snapping are knocked to the ground. You fall prone. 
As you look up, you see a familiar face. The face you have been looking for. You see your brother.

### [[Valentine]]
You sprint through the woods, trying to rid yourself of the sounds in your head. Stumbling and tripping on the roots that you are sure are trying to break your ankle. When in reality it's from the ale that you have downed for the night. **Roll Perception**
You look down and see a glimmering light, recognizing the face of your sister. 

### [[Twig]]
You had to prove yourself to become a member of the adventurers guild of the Whispering Vale. You now have been adventuring long enough to become an official member. You enter the tavern, seeing a moon elf that you have never seen before.
