### House Rules
- If you are proficient in Medicine, you get the Healer feat for free
- [Sanctuary](mechanics.md#Sanctuary)
- Each player starts with inspiration to use how they wish. If they roll a nat 1, they gain back a spent inspiration. These cannot stack.
- [Death Saves](mechanics.md#Death%20Saves)
**Hidden Death Saves**
- [Everything Done in Turns](mechanics.md#Turns)
- If you can explain why there is a good reason your chances are higher you can get advantage. Ex: if you attack from a higher position, or build off someone's attack
- If you roll a crit, instead of rolling 2 dice, you roll 1 dice and then add the max number you could roll to get your total. Example, a longsword deals 1d8 damage; roll one dice and then add 8 to get your total crit damage.
- Creation:
	- Everyone gets a free feat at level 1.
	- When rolling for hit points, reroll 1s and 2s.
	- You get both the +2 ASI and a feat.
- Fate
	- At any time in the game a player may reroll any D20 roll. The fate die is then given to the DM. The DM may use it to reroll any D20 roll. The fate die is then given back to the players.
- Combat
	- Called shots: Â If you attack without disadvantage, you can instead choose to attack with disadvantage to target a specific body part. On a hit the attack might carry additional effects to be determined by the DM.
	- You can use skill checks to learn about a creature when you first encounter it. The DM will then give you general information about the creature.
