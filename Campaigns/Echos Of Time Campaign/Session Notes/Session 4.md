Present: [[Valentine]], [[Twig]], [[Darrow]],
Location: [[Shadowglen]]

[[Tarot#Nine of Pentacles]]
 Spoke to the god, asking for protection from [[Silvarin]].
 Witches road between both realms. 

[[Darrow]]
Added weighted blankets to the game. 

Multiple guards around the town at watch towers. Placed around to watch for anything that may be suspicious. 

Guard mentions that Byrn was infected with the blight. Bryn was infected with blight. The blight was inside of his leg. All of the people that have been infected have been unconscious so far. 

[[Twig]]
Walks in the inn, and meets with Darrow. They both go to talk to the wisps. The wisps tell them that there are other groves like that one and they all feel the same and that they are scared of them and that they hurt them. The wisps tell them that they may help them find the other groves. They tell them that the groves feel like they are trying to eat them and that when they get too close then some of them disappear. 


[[Valentine]]
Sends a message to everyone telling them that they are awake and to try to find them. Confidently marches off in the wrong direction and meets with [[Jareth Nightforge]] at the blacksmith and lets slip that [[Stella]] is a fairy. [[Jareth Nightforge]] decides that this is the perfect opportunity to kidnap [[Stella]] since she is a fae creature and to give her to the [[Coven of Whispered Secrets]].  Evokes [[Silvarin]] 's name. They get a feeling that the god is trying to talk to them but they are unable at the moment because of a language barrier.  It tells Valentine that the high priestess will be getting ahold of him. 


The group is not allowed at the blacksmith here any longer. They are also not in the best graces of the guards and are arrested.
