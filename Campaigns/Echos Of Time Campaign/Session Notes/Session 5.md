Present: [[Naula]], [[Valentine]], [[Twig]], [[Darrow]], [[Stella]], [[Scarlet]]
Location: [[Shadowglen]]

[[Twig]] and [[Darrow]] are able to talk their way out of going to a jail cell. They instead have to pay a fine of 500 gold and repair the door that was fixed. For the remainder of the time in town they will be escorted by a guard for each player. 

[[Stella]] Wakes up in the coven, she tries to escape and she realizes that she is wrapped in vines and gossamer. The coven members realize that she wakes up and step back from the cleansing process, calling [[Silvarin]] and leaving. He talks to [[Stella]] in druidic where he tells her that he sacrifices the fae creatures. She tries to use magic and realizes that the building is has an anti-fae magic barrier surrounding it. While speaking to [[Silvarin]], he mentions that he needs all the help of fae creatures that he finds to help him repair the voids. He says that he will be doing another ritual in 2 days time. He is truly respectful while telling [[Stella]] that he is going to sacrifice her, as though he does think this is the only way. He mentions that [[Stella]] is familiar, she remembers that her grandparents used to be a part of the coven.

[[Twig]], [[Naula]], and [[Darrow]] are able to repair the door in 3 hours. During those 3 hours they are able to talk to the high priestess, [[Evelyn Nightshade]], about [[Stella]] and trying to get her back. [[Darrow]] is able to talk to [[Silvarin]] and convince him to give them 2 weeks to figure out how to heal the voids in the groves. When he moves to shake [[Silvarin]] 's metaphorical hand his had turns to stone. Over the course of the next 2 weeks he will slowly turn to stone.
