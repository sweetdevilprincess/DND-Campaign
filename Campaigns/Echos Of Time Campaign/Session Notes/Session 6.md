Bioluminescent bloom for 1 d 4 days. Slightly chilly. Slightly foggy


[[Valentine]], [[Naula]], [[Darrow]], and [[Twig]] group up together and go to the job board to look for work in the morning. They decide to take on a few jobs and split up, Stella and Scarlet shared a room the night before and did not wake up as early as they did. 
[[Naula]] alters one of her gauntlet to do 1 d 4 piercing damage on top of her gauntlet damage. 

The jobs that they decided on were:
 - A lost cat that needed to be returned to it's owner. The cat was last seen chasing glowing moths.
 - Wisps that are bothering a woman on the outskirts of the town.
 - Strange voices being heard from someone's basement
 - Spiders in basement.
 - Wards if time (did not take sheet)

[[Naula]] and [[Valentine]] group up to look for the lost cat and [[Darrow]] and [[Twig]] decide to go to talk to the wisps. As the groups get ready to split up, the [[Ogre Guard]] stops them and takes them to [[Byrn Forgeheart]] so that he can confirm that they were not the ones that hurt him. He admits that one of the attackers had wings and that all of them were quite a bit taller. 

The festival is tomorrow. Sylas comes during the festival, the Town is incredibly alive during this time. The woman talks about the wisps saying that they are talking about [[Byrn Forgeheart]] and his mother. The cat is a Calico, it is a black, white and orange boy cat. The cat looks similar in size and look to a Maine coon, just a bit bigger. 
[[Darrow]] uses his bedroll to contain the car, it is now ripped to shreds. 
The cat's name is Jobie. 

[[Valentine]] and [[Naula]] find a hollowed out stump with a large grey and white cat with 7 kittens. 
Rowan's death is on Valentine's Birthday
[[Naula]] offers to engrave Jobie's collar for Jobie's birthday. 

[[Naula]] picks 1 cat and names it Valdin
[[Valentine]] picks a cat and names it River because he thinks that is what [[Rowan]] name is. 
[[Twig]] picks a cat and names it Twig
[[Darrow]] picks a cat and names it Jerry Sinefield

[[Naula]] and [[Valentine]] get 15 g to split 
[[Darrow]] and [[Twig]] get 12 g and 2 odd looking coins.
The odd looking coins are magic. 
[[Naula]] has for sure seen the pattern before.
