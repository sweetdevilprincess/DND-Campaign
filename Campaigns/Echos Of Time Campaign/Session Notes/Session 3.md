Present: [[Naula]], [[Valentine]], [[Twig]], [[Scarlet]]

## Recap
The Party goes through the forest. Meeting the wisps and finding a dwarf in a grove. Twig carried the dwarf while Naula carried an unconscious Valentine to Shadowglen. A two week travel from Glimmershade in a single night. They leave Valentine, Stella, and the dwarf at the med tent. They are instructed not to leave town until they are questioned. They are not being arrested but the guard does have questions for them. Because they have to stay, they are given a discount at the inn. Darrow bought an Obsidian dagger, and Naula is determined to prove her skill to the blacksmith. 

Light drizzle. Is Rowan. 
[[Valentine]] loses another memory. He gets the [[Tarot#Ace of Swords]], [[Valentine]]. DM used the fate dice to drop perception roll to check whether or not it is Rowan. A spell and poem that [[Valentine]] wrote is needed to open the witches road for him and [[Rowan]]. Rowan tells Valentine that the witches road for them is in the town right outside of Misthaven. 
Valentine asks questions:
 - Do you feel any relief not what he is on the other side. Rowan is not allowed to talk about that day. He slightly deflects telling Valentine that Valentine holding him and talking him through it made it more bearable and he will forever cherish the moments. 
 - Asks if he can make the group into a coven. Rowan tells him that a coven is a family, that he is happy that Valentine has found a family that he deserved, that he is sorry that it could not be him.
 - Valentine asks about the book of poems and asks if the poem is in his book that Rowan gave to him. Rowan states that it had to be a part of both of them, his magic, Valentine's poem. 
 - Why didn't your god bring you back. Rowan gets upset at the question. Knowing that [[Vaernis]] did bring him back, and Valentine telling him that if he loved him enough then he would have asked when he had begged to be returned. Valentine gets mad that he wont answer the question telling him that he is dead, what is the worse thing that could happen. Rowan responds that him dying is not the worse thing that could happen to him. 
 - Rowan says that he knew about his sister because his mother knew Valentine's grandparents and that the witches road was supposed to take them there so that they would be safe, but Valentine's parents killed the grandparents.
 - Valentine thinks that Rowans had something to do with his grandparents death. And that hurts him deeply. Valentine does not connect the dots that his grandparents died after Rowan did. 
 - Valentine claims that he will get revenge. Rowan states that they will get what they deserve.
 - What happens on the Witches Road? It is different for everyone. 
Valentine wakes up in a panic.
