Present: [[Valentine]], [[Twig]], [[Scarlet]]
Location: [[Shadowglen]]
Scarlet is marked and watched. She sees a [[Celestial Deer#Celestial Stag]] and ignores it.
Valentine loses the first time that Rowan said that he loved him. Valentine sees eyes in the forest and then also sees the [[Celestial Deer#Celestial Stag]]. He goes up to it, touches it, the stag speaks to him and tells him 

		"You are kind, if you and your friends continue to do so, I will help you along the way. But if you do not act kindly toward them I will make sure you all pay."

Twig uses mold earth to tunnel through the wreckage of the collapse. He sends Naula to talk to the person that would be paying them. While carving out the tunnel he is able to get 
 - 6 iridescent chitins
 - 2 refraction glands
 - 4 light reflecting fangs
Twig heard the matriarch scarping and scratching at the collapsed tunnel. Twig goes up and talks to the man that would be paying them, the man says that the spiders have been left to their own devices for about 2 seasons, about 6 months. Twig explained what it had looked like down there and how many spiders there were. The man paid them, apologizing that the job was much larger than they had realized. Told Twig that if there is a way for them to show that there was a Matriarch then they are willing to up the pay for the help. The man did tell Twig that he had to dock a portion of the pay because of the damage to the basemen. The man paid 45 gold, 15 docked for damage. Twig did mention that he would be going back the day after the festival to repair the tunnel for him. 

Scarlet and Valentine go to [[Draven Moonshadow]], Draven questions them about the mushrooms, Scarlet admits that she picked extras and left them there, Draven treats Scarlet for all of the squishy ones that she may have picked. She takes 1 level of exhaustion and is paid 125 gold. Draven asks to check on Stella and and they discover that she is gone. Scarlet mentions that she seems like she grew a bit, Draven mentions that no one has ever really seen a fairy before. Scarlet asks about learning potion stuff from Draven, Draven says that after the Blight is dealt with he will likely be able to open up his shop again. Draven mentions [[Spirit's Rest]] and says that the symbol is the same that is on the coin and his necklace 
Darrow asks the librarian if there is a way to stop from turning to stone and asks about the books.

The group goes down for the night. The room is 25 gold a night. They split it 5 gold a piece. Waking they see that it is super foggy, hear light rain. During festival days, [[Shadowglen]] supplies meals for the whole town.
