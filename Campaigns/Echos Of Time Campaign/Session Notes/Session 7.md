# Old Storehouse
Inside the first room is quite dusty, there are old sheets that cover everything, directly in front of the entrance is a counter with an open door to the back. Walking through the door leads to a back room, in this room is a table on the righthand side with boxes piled high and rows of old shelves filled with old stock. To the left of the door in this room is a staircase that leads down to the basement. In the basement there are 2 swarms of glowing spiders. They will not attack the players until the spider mother is disturbed.
