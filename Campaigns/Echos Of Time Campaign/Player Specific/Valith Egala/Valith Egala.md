# Valith Egala Overview

##### Valith
Valith on a personal level is shy and protective


##### Backstory
Valith was born a recognized bastard, and youngest of four, both sisters pure blood human, into the noble house, House Egala. There she was raised by a resentful mother and abusive father with minor sympathy given by her sisters and brother, [[Mordra]] Egala; the most sympathetic eldest who ran away to marry a commoner, [[Eliya]] Egala; the second child, who shirks the duties of nobility to be with “the licentious folk” and drink the night away. Erin would often join in with mother and father, [[Veska]] and [[Alton]] respectively, to berate and belittle Valith during her formative years but would console and love behind closed doors. Finally there is [[Charon]] Egala, the golden child who passed away in a tournament to test his skill and might for his family, leaving only Valith Egala to inherit their noble line.

Her only source of true comfort within the household came to her around the age of 23 in the form of [[Naula]] Ironfist. [[Naula]] is what one would best describe as hot headed and blunt which enthralled Valith immediately, giving her a way to be herself without fear of being judged or talked around. She would often go to [[Naula]]’s workshop to both vent to her as well as learn and even prototype weapons with her, acting as both an apprentice and confidant to [[Naula]].

One night she began having a dream in which [[Vaernis]], the god of vengeful death came to her and told her of a new type of weapon and assistance for a price, rescue from her family in exchange, to feed. Valith agreed and began showing the idea for weaponizing a Sunfyre Crystal. In an attempt to understand the dream and weapon she went to [[Naula]] with her dreams to see if she could find a way to make it work with current technological and magical understanding. After many tests and trials a working prototype was made. A rudimentary case for a Sunfyre crystal embedded inside of a handle with a springlocked lever to strike said Sunfyre crystal, activating whatever spell was stored inside through a tube. After final touches and final stylizing, [[Naula]] leaves to begin work on a weapon of her own using the knowledge. After [[Naula]]’s return after some workshopping, engraved in gold letters are the names of Valith’s mother and father.

After the invention of their new weapon [[Naula]] convinced Valith to take the firearm and run to [[Naula]]’s old home with the dwarves, there they would meet up and proceed with what to do with the firearm. After some debating and tears Valith decides that would be the wisest idea and leaves. After a few days of travel she is followed shortly by [[Naula]] to meet with the dwarves to ask about the weapon.

## Player Ideas for character
Wants to kill her parents. 
**Maybe** have it so that [[Vaernis]] has been telling her that the bloodline is ruined and that after she kills her parents he wants her to kill her siblings too, if she does he tells her that there is only one left. Her.
