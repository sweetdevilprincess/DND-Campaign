Orc guard speaks with naula about them finding the dwarf. Does not recall the air feeling weird, no one was around noticed that there were 2 styles of runes on the marble table, one, more complex on the side and a simpler one on the top lining the edge. Asks about Valith and if someone that fits her description has been seen. **Sees Naula strong like her**

- Altered one of her gauntlets to do 1d4 piercing damage on top of regular gauntlet damage
