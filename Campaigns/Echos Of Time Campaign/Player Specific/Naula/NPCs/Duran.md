Known for his exceptional skill as a blacksmith, he has always been fascinated by different metallurgical techniques and magical enhancements. One day, while on a trading expedition, he discovered an abandoned Goliath infant. Despite the potential challenges, Duran's compassionate nature led him to adopt the child, naming her Naula.

As Naula grew, Duran taught her everything he knew about smithing, imbuing her with a deep appreciation for dwarven craftsmanship. He encouraged her natural talents while helping her navigate the challenges of being different from the rest of the clan. When the opportunity arose for Naula to serve as an ambassador to the Egala family, Duran supported her, seeing it as a chance for her to grow and bring new knowledge back to the clan.
