# Naula Ironfist
A tribal through and through. Is only civilized because she has to be. 

## Backstory
Naula Ironfist Verida, born Naula Steelfist, was orphaned in the mountains of the kingdom of Verida to a small nomadic clan of dwarves numbering only 50 dwarves. Over the years she grew up under her father [[Duran]] Steelfist, helping him with the forge. On her tenth birthday she finally learned that she was adopted (though she already assumed as much, considering her height compared to the other members of her clan.) and was told that she was allowed to change her name if she liked. She opted to change her name simply to include the kingdom she resided in, similar to traditional goliath naming conventions. She continued to work with her father in their forge, learning the art of armor working and smithing.

One faithful year while in her father’s forge she was approached by a member of her clan, her personal friend and rival, [[Valdin]] on behalf of the clan chief. She was given a task to act as both ambassador and smith for the noble house Egala.

From then on she began to expand on her knowledge of metallurgy and even began to learn about magic as well, incorporating it into her craft. She began prototyping new armors for the family, using herself as both a test bed for said armors and her up and starting social skills among civilized society. Though her proudest achievement was what she would later adopt as her standard weapon, a pair of fine crafted, steel gauntlets with her father’s runework etched into them to act as a catalyst for any magical augmentation and spells she wanted to attach to the gauntlets. She embedded a Sunfyre crystal to allow for mana storage for said spells. To name a couple of augments she can perform with said gauntlets controlling the air around them to either heat or freeze it (though not strong enough to be useful in combat though a work in progress), strengthen them to allow for more durability and lastly, she can expand the gauntlets to encase her arms in metal, allowing her to basically act as a shield. The largest downside to any of this is of course, the crystal inside must be recharged to be able to enhance her magic capabilities. Without said battery though any magic that can be used with the gauntlets is both null and void, defaulting to regular gauntlets. Being gauntlets though they still pack a punch when used as a striking weapon.

Over the next five to ten years after prototyping many weapons with [[Valith Egala]] she resents the family that took her from her mountain home and family, watching how they treated their only daughter who she began to take interest in, vowing to take the first chance she can to desert. She began to plan in secrecy, slowly building a relationship with the heiress to the family and convincing her to flee, telling her to seek out the dwarves who once took Naula in. 

During one of her long and grueling shifts, that day came in the form of a request from the family. The heir to the family fortune and title went missing. Seeing as how Naula was the only one that [[Valith Egala]] trusted within the manor they asked her to find their missing daughter. Seeing the opportunity to scorn the family and finally desert she takes it, faking her death and dodging any search party and spies that the family sent to hunt her and [[Valith Egala]].

Naula is not known for her discretion unless needed, being raised by dwarves. She is stubborn, loud and destructive in the best situations, being boisterous and a party goer. She will tell you when she isn’t happy with a situation and will tell you when she thinks you are being an idiot. She also has a tendency to hold grudges (a byproduct of her raised family) and will scorn the people who wrong her. But keep on her good side, she is an ally for life. She is loyal, though some would say too loyal, and trusting. She may not act it but she is quite intelligent.

## Player Ideas for character
Wants to prove herself and be able to harness the power of the [[Sunfire Crystals]] like on one has before. 


## DM Ideas
Have her sent back in time and learn the magic from Etherium. While there she is able to transfer her consciousness into a construct. Somewhat successful, cannot transfer her entire soul, only a portion
