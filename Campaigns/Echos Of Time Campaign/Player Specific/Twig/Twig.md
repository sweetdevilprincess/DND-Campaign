## Info 
Has taken 5-6 jobs for the adventurers guild. Is officially part of the guild now. Had 1 job where he had to hunt wolves. He knows about the forest and has even heard rumors about the doors. He does not know where they go, but he has heard about them. 

##### Backstory
Mother was an earth elemental, father was a human. Lived in a small elemental camp just south of [[Whispering Hollow]], on the edge of the boundary between the [[Whispering Vale]] and the [[Ethereal Veil]]. Easy childhood. Always looked up to adventurers. Listening to their stories when they would venture into [[Whispering Hollow]]. Trained with Elemental magic and heavy weaponry before leaving his camp. 
Left as a coming of age rite of passage. Since leaving, life has not been easy. He has had many dangerous experiences which has led to him being more of a reserved person. He will do his best to do good by anyone he meets. If someone if put into a dangerous situation then he will not be nice. 

## Player ideas for character
Wants to slowly become more chaotic. His elemental and tiefling heritage take over a bit. He does not want to evoke rage, he just is. 

## DM Ideas
Learns or a sort of elemental council that his mother does not approve of, which is why she left. He proves himself and they allow him onto the council. The council assesses other Elemental gods that have lost their humanity/sanity and they are trying to replace them with ones that haven't. Twig replaces the Whispering Vale Forest Elemental God.
