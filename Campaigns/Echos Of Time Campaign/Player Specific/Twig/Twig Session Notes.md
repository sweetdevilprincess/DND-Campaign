Gets breakfast, speaks with the Orc guard about them finding the dwarf. The air felt heavy. No one was around, noticed that the table was engraved but didn't notice what it said. Mentions that the group just met up within the last 24 hrs. 

- Grouped with Darrow to investigate the wisps
- Picked a kitten and named it Twig
- Earned 12g and 2 odd looking magic coins (split with Darrow)
- Went to the storehouse with Darrow, killed spiders, harvested remains. Able to talk to the owner after damaging the storehouse. Agreed to help rebuild the tunnel the day after the festival.
