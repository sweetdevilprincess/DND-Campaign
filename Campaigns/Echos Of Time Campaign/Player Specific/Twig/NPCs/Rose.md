### Background
Rose came from a long line of Earthen elementals. Older member's of her family still guard many ancient and sacred groves, ensuring that the natural balance is maintained. She is a healer within the elemental camp, assisting [[Orin|Orin]] with injuries that newcomers often are faced with when dealing with the power of elementals for the first time.
Rose, much like her name, is delicate and gentle yet very firm and deeply rooted. She is often very protective of her family and the land. 
After having [[Twig]] she began to settle down and distance herself from the more dangerous parts of protecting the land.
