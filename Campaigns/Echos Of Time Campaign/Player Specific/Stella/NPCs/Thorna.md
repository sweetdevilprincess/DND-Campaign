An old woman with silver hair. She often made flower crowns for her and [[Stella]] from the flowers that they gathered from the forest and her garden. She practiced a natural form of Alchemy, creating potent magical concoctions. She passed some of the knowledge to [[Stella]], letting her create stronger health potions that what is usually found. She is the one that had discovered that [Tushar](Valentine.md) had been adopted. This was a constant fight between the two about just going to retrieve him and doing it in a way that would keep all of them safe.  
She and [[Eldrin]] were able to take [[Stella]] from [[Avanna]] and [[Alaric]] and protect her, but by the time they had learned of [Tushar](Valentine.md), it was too late, they could not risk stepping in and taking him from the home without evoking the wrath of the town. After telling [[Stella]] of her brother, She and [[Eldrin]] used their divination magic to see [[Stella]] and [Tushar](Valentine.md) 's parents come and kill them. Before being struck down, they wrote a letter to each of them and hid it within their property.
