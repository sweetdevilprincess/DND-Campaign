### Background
Stella is a fairy, raised by her grandparents, [[Eldrin]] and [[Thorna]], from a young age, due to her parents being “unfit” in their eyes. The grandparent, knowing the ways of magic, forgotten and not, taught Stella all they could. Because of them, she knows how to use the forest to her advantage. She was taught how to survive and even thrive in the wilderness. 

The news broke of her parents' adoption of [Tushar](Valentine.md), her tiefling adoptive brother. She knew little of her parents, but she knew that [Tushar](Valentine.md) would not be safe with them so she returned to them. 

After her return, Stella’s parents found her using magic. They confronted her and forced her to tell them who taught her. After much arguing, her parents found who had taught her and left to confront them themselves. 

Up until this point Stella had been receiving messages from her grandparents, confirming their wellbeing as well as her own and Tushar’s.

During this she was forbidden from using magic. Her parents took anything that they thought belonged to her grandparents or might be magical and destroyed it. All she was able to keep was (Insert a small magical item that you would have been able to keep concealed), which she held dear. 

She packed the little she had and left to check on her grandparents. Her worst fears came true when she saw their home destroyed, and within she found what little left of their remains. Her emotions hit her like a crashing wave. She returned to her parents house to tell [Tushar](Valentine.md) of her plan to leave. She gave her brother, which she barely knew but cared for deeply, a tight hug before leaving her parent’s home for the last time.
