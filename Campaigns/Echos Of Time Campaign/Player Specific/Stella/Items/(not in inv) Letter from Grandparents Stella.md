My dearest Stella,

If you're reading this, then our fears have come to pass, and we are no longer with you. Know that our love for you is eternal, transcending even death itself. You have brought so much joy and purpose to our lives, and we are immensely proud of the strong, compassionate young woman you've become.

We must confess our deepest regret - our failure to protect your brother, Valentine. By the time we learned of his existence, it was too late for us to intervene without risking all of our safety. This burden has weighed heavily on our hearts, and we hope that you can forgive us for our inaction.

Stella, you possess a rare gift - not just your magical abilities, but your kind heart and unwavering spirit. Use these gifts wisely. The magic we've taught you is a tool, but your compassion is your true strength. Never stop learning, growing, and fighting for what's right.

We fear dark times may be ahead. Trust in the lessons we've taught you about the forest and its spirits. The Wisps, in particular, can be powerful allies if treated with respect. Remember, in nature, there is always balance and renewal - let this guide you in times of trouble.

Find Valentine. Protect him, love him, and help him understand that he is not the monster your parents claimed him to be. You two are stronger together than apart.

Lastly, know that we did not leave you willingly. We fought until the end, and our only solace is knowing that our teachings live on in you. You are our legacy, Stella, and we know you will do great things.

All our love, always and forever, Grandpa Eldrin and Grandma Thorna

P.S. In the hollow of the old oak behind our cottage, you'll find a final gift from us. Use it wisely.
