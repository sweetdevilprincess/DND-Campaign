**Addition Benefit:** +2 Charisma when interacting with fae creatures; increases to +3 with fairies after the Queen's death

**Drawback:** Failed saves against Queen's Call increase to DC 17; after the Queen's death, the forest itself attempts to make her the new Queen through increasingly insistent magical effects
