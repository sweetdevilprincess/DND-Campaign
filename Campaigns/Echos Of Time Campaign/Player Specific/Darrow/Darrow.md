# Backstory
Born to traveling elven parents Darrow 





Moon elf 101 years old looks to be around 17-20. Pale skin and medium length white hair
Haed to move around his whole life with his parents, mother [[Elara]] and father [[Finnian]] who were traveling magicians/bards. They were killed by a mysterious assassin [[Assassin (Vex)]] looking for a certain text in their possession. 

Alchemist specialty 

He goes to [[Sunspire Citadel]] l in an attempt to learn. He is taken in as an assistant for the Aasimar [[Seraphiel]], he jumps at the opportunity as that is the only way to learn Celestial. He hears of their plan to rid the world of knowledge of Etherium. He runs and tries to save the knowledge that may be at the ruins.



Friend with [[Thalia Fireforge]]
Gave 2 books to thalia 

## Player plans for character
Knowledge is the most important thing. He wants to preserve all the knowledge that he can. He is disgusted that the Aasimar would try to destroy the knowledge of Etherium. He wants to help others preserve knowledge and believes that the pursuit of knowledge is the most important path 


## DM Ideas
Give Darrow an opportunity to rebuild the school in [[Sunspire Citadel]]. He would dedicate himself to knowledge and form a relationship with [[Threnodyn]] to keep the knowledge alive.
