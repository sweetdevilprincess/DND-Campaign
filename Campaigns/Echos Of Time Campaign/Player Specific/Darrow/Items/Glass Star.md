**This Item can only be repaired by the creature of this item**

**Benefit:** Can perfectly record any knowledge or memory encountered into the star's crystalline structure

- **Additional Benefit:** Once per day, can share stored knowledge directly with another person (giving them advantage on any knowledge check related to the shared information). Also, can create temporary physical manifestations of stored knowledge (like a spellbook or tome that lasts 24 hours)

- **Drawback:** Each use slightly accelerates petrification, but the knowledge stored remains even if Darrow fully petrifies. After petrification is not an issue, it begins slowly crystallizing Darrow's memories, making him increasingly reliant on the star as a external memory source
