### Backstory
A changling assassin and skilled thief, specializing in the acquisition and elimination of threats to the new gods' power.

Vex was tasked by the corrupt Aasimar leadership to track down and eliminate anyone with knowledge of Etherium or the true gods. This mission led them to Darrow's parents, Elara and Finnian. Vex killed them to obtain the scroll they possessed, but the artifact was nowhere to be found, leading to an ongoing search.
