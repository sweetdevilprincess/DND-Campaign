### Backstory

Elara Moonshadow was born into a secluded elven community known for its diviners. From a young age, she displayed an exceptional talent for foresight, often experiencing vivid visions of possible futures. This gift, while powerful, was also a burden, as Elara struggled to interpret and act upon her visions.

Seeking to understand her abilities better, Elara left her community to study at various magical institutions. It was during this time that she first heard whispers of Etherium and the true gods. Intrigued, she began to secretly research these topics, using her divination skills to uncover hidden knowledge.

Elara met Finnian during a magical performance where their talents complemented each other perfectly. As they fell in love and started traveling together, Elara's visions became more focused, often centered around a future involving a powerful artifact and a child with a crucial destiny.

When Darrow was born, Elara knew he was the child from her visions. She dedicated herself to protecting him and preparing him for his future role, all while continuing her search for information about Etherium. Her divination skills were instrumental in acquiring the scroll containing crucial information about the forgotten kingdom.

Elara was always more reserved than Finnian, preferring to work behind the scenes. She used her abilities to guide their travels, avoid dangers, and uncover hidden truths. However, the weight of her knowledge and the constant glimpses of potential futures took a toll on her, making her sometimes seem distant or preoccupied.

In her final years, Elara's visions became more urgent and fragmented. She knew a great danger was approaching but couldn't pinpoint its exact nature. Her last act was to use her magic to conceal the scroll, ensuring it would pass safely to Darrow.
