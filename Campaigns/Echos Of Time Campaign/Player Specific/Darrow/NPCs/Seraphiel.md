### Backstory
Seraphiel Dawnwhisper is a high-ranking Aasimar within [[Sunspire Citadel]], responsible for overseeing the training of promising young mages. They present themselves as a wise and benevolent mentor, but beneath this facade lies a cunning individual dedicated to suppressing knowledge of [[Etherium]] and the true gods.

Seraphiel was drawn to [[Darrow]]'s potential, seeing an opportunity to either recruit a powerful ally or neutralize a potential threat. They took [[Darrow]] under their wing, offering to teach him Celestial and advanced magic, all while subtly attempting to indoctrinate him into the Aasimar's worldview.

Unknown to most, Seraphiel is a key figure in the conspiracy to erase all traces of [[Etherium]] and the true gods. They believe that the Aasimar's divine right to rule comes from the new gods and see any challenge to this as a threat to their power and way of life.

He has an estranged sister, [[Elara Dawnwhisper]], that lives deep within the [[Whispering Vale]]. He does not have any ill will toward her, but is disapproving of her not flying and believe that she is not living up to her full potential.
