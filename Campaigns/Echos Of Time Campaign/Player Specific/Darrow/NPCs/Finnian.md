### Backstory
Finnian Moonshadow was born into a family of travelling performers, learning the art of illusion and entertainment from a young age. His natural charm and magical talent made him a rising star in the world of magical performance. However, Finnian's curiosity always drove him to seek more than just applause.

During his travels, Finnian began to hear tales of ancient magic and forgotten realms. His interest piqued, he started using his performances as a cover to gather information about these myths. His ability to blend in and charm information out of people made him an excellent investigator.

Finnian met Elara during one of his performances, and he was immediately drawn to her quiet intensity and incredible magical ability. As they began travelling together, Finnian found that his skills perfectly complemented Elara's divination abilities. He used his illusions and charm to distract and misdirect, while Elara used her foresight to guide their path.

When Darrow was born, Finnian took on the role of the primary caregiver while they were on the road. He taught Darrow the basics of magic, always emphasizing the importance of creativity and adaptability. Finnian used his illusions to create fantastic stories for Darrow, many of which contained hidden truths about Etherium and the true gods.

Finnian's research led him to discover the existence of the scroll containing information about Etherium. Using a combination of charm, illusion, and Elara's divination, he managed to acquire it. However, this acquisition put them on the radar of dangerous individuals.

In his final years, Finnian became increasingly paranoid about protecting the scroll and his family. He used his illusions to create multiple false trails and identities, always staying one step ahead of their pursuers. His last act was to create a complex illusion to hide Darrow and the scroll, buying time for his son to escape.
