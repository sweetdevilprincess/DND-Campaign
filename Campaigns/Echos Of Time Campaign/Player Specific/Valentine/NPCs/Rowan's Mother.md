Elf woman
##### Backstory
[[Rowan]] 's mother watched as the bond between the boys grew. She welcomed [Tushar](Valentine.md) into her home with open arms. She always noticed the fresh bruises and cuts that lined [Tushar](Valentine.md) 's skin. And when his parent's had broken his horns and shaved them down for the first time her home was the one that [Tushar](Valentine.md) ran to. She watched as [Tushar](Valentine.md) 's eyes would dim whenever he spoke of his parents. She quickly came to understand the darkness that hung over his home and that was the day that she decided that he was her child. That his parents weren't worthy of having a son as loving and caring as him to break.  

[[Rowan]]'s mother cared very deeply for [Tushar](Valentine.md), seeing a side of him that only [[Rowan]] was able to see. She saw him as her own child, and therefore saw Valentine's parents for who they really were.

When [[Rowan]] and [Tushar](Valentine.md) had decided to flee, she gave them her blessing and send [[Rowan]] with a map. Once news had broken of [[Rowan]] 's death she mourned the loss of two sons. She had hoped that [Tushar](Valentine.md) had fled safely but no news every came of him.
