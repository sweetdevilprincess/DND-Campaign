Dear Valentine,

We address you by this name, the one given to you by someone who truly saw and loved you, because we want you to know that we see you too – the real you, not the person others have tried to force you to be.

We are Eldrin and Thorna, your grandparents, and though we've never had the chance to formally meet, you have been in our hearts every day since we learned of your existence. We write this letter with both love and deep regret, knowing we may never have the opportunity to embrace you as we've longed to do so.

First and foremost, we want you to know that you are loved, Valentine. Unconditionally and without reservation. You are not a monster, nor are you broken or in need of fixing. You are perfect exactly as you are – a bright, beautiful soul with boundless potential.

We must beg your forgiveness for our greatest failure – not being able to rescue you from the cruel environment you were raised in. By the time we learned of your adoption, intervening would have put all of us, including your sister Stella, in grave danger. This decision has haunted us every day since.

You may wonder how we know so much about you. Rowan's mother, a dear friend and ally, has been our eyes and ears, watching over you when we could not. She loved you as her own, as did we. The map she gave you and Rowan was meant to lead you to us. We're so sorry you never made it here, but know that you were always in our thoughts and hearts.

Valentine, you possess strength beyond measure. The hardships you've endured would break lesser individuals, but you have persevered. Your Tiefling heritage is not a curse, but a wellspring of unique power and perspective. Embrace it, for it is an integral part of who you are.

We hope that by the time you read this, you and Stella have found each other. Lean on each other, support one another. The bond between siblings can be one of life's greatest sources of strength and comfort.

Know that wherever we are, we are watching over you with pride and love. You are capable of incredible things, Valentine. Never let anyone convince you otherwise. The love you shared with Rowan was pure and true – hold onto that love, let it be a light in dark times.

With all our love and hope for your bright future, Your grandparents, Eldrin and Thorna

P.S. In the roots of the willow tree by the stream behind our cottage, you'll find something that rightfully belongs to you. May it serve as a reminder of your true worth and the family that has always loved you.
