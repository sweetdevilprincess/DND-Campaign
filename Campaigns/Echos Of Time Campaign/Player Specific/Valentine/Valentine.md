# Notes 
Keeps his tail hidden in his pants, his horns are hidden beneath his hat. Knows vaguely about [[Misthaven]]. He knows about the forest decently well and can traverse it ok-ish. (Advantage) because his parents left him alone in it when they weren't abusing him. Mentioned that end game is his character dies for his new friends. He would sacrifice himself for his friends knowing that when he died at least he had people who cared for him. He wants to try to find a witches path. 
##### Backstory
Tushar’s parents were both human. They were known around the town as somewhat distant and secluded people. They weren’t necessarily cold-hearted to the townsfolk, preferring to keep up the appearance of being a savior to Tushar after they found him as a babe. 

Though they are not known to be cold hearted publicly, they are known to have a silver tongue and they used it to get whatever they wanted, mostly in the guise of helping Tushar and his sister [[Stella]]

His parents often would comment that he owed them his life as they saved his. They would often comment on how he would grow up to be a terrible person, because all teifling are terrible and evil. Once Tushar began growing horns the abuse from his adoptive parents became physical, holding him down and breaking off his horns and sanding them down. 

Because of this abuse Tushar would often lash out toward other kids, which they used to further prove their point. The children began calling him a “freak” and a “monster”. This grew to him repeatedly saying that he wasn’t, trying to convince them, and himself while inflicting pain as a form of punishment. 

The only one that believed he wasn’t a monster was his childhood friend, and boyfriend, [[Rowan]] . Due to Tushar’s parents they kept the relationship hidden, afraid of how they would take it. They had planned to run away together, for him to take Tushar away from his broken and abusive family. 

On the day that they were supposed to leave, Tushar met at the spot they had agreed to meet to find [[Rowan]] beaten body. Tushar held him as he took his dying breath. His boyfriend made him promise to leave without him and to keep himself safe.

Tushar confronted his parents, who only told him it was tough love and that he deserved it for lying to them. They said that they did it to protect him. At this point Tushar had begun to believe their lies. 

Tushar ran away that night. Since then Tushar had tried his best to grieve the loss of his lover and best friend. One way that he does this is he writes poetry for him. The boyfriend had always said that he loved Tushar’s poetry and that it made him look so beautiful when he would work on it. 

Tushar now spends time at the library, his late lover's favorite place. Reading anything he can get his hands on to try to keep his mind from thinking. 

Tushar has a special deck of playing cards that have been cut from metal that the boyfriend gave to him as an anniversary gift. He said that he wanted Tushar to have a way to keep himself safe that wasn’t noticeable. 

Tushar has always been allowed to use magic as it was another way that his parents could use him. They allowed him to practice and train which was one of his only ways of release. Since his boyfriend passed, he hasn’t been able to bring himself to use it. He prefers hand to hand, to get down and dirty with it. 

## Player Ideas for Character
After feeling like he does belong wants a noble sacrifice.

## DM Ideas
