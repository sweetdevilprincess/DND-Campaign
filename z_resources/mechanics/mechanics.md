###### Extra Spell Slots
- Players are able to use an extra spell slot, as long as DM rolls a D 20 to determine if the spell works as expected. Spells may backfire hitting a party member, the caster, or anyone else. Players may allow the DM to roll on a wild magic table as another option to use an extra spell slot.

#### Environmental Conditions

##### Anti-magic Clouds
Roll a d4 to determine the wind direction: 1=N, 2=E, 3=S, 4=W. Has a radius of 6d10 ft (minimum 20 ft) and acts as a antimagic field. At the end of every round roll a d 20. On a 1-4 the cloud lingers in place. 5-19 the cloud moves in the direction that the wind is blowing by 30 ft. Nat 20 roll again. The cloud sucks away all forms of magic until the end of the next round.

##### Blight 

##### Bog and Swamp
- Experienced wetlands travelers are adept at spotting signs of this lurking danger. Characters walking at their normal walking speed notice with a successful DC 8 WIS (survival) check or a passive Wisdom (perception) of 8+. Those traveling faster than their normal speed walk right into the mud or Bog and sink. Rolling to see how far the character sinks in is 1d3 per turn. (EX. Human steps into mud, rolls a 3 and sinks 1/3 of the way in. Whereas a 1 would have just been knees.) As long as the creature is not submerged they can escape themselves on a DC of 10 + the number of feet sunk in. When submerged another character must assist and on a DC of 5 + ft may help them out.

##### Extreme Heat 
- When the temperature is at or above 100 F a creature exposed to the heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a CON saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.
- Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeed on the saving throw. As do creatures naturally adapted to the natural climate. 
##### Lava 
- A creature that touches lava takes 27 (5d10) fire damage. When a creature enters lava or starts it's turn there it will take 55 (10d10) fire damage. A creature submerged takes 110 (20d10).
	- **Volcanic Fields**: Magma can leap out of fissures in that form with little to no warning, spitting flaming death up into the air. Every 100ft of travel in a Volcanic Field, roll 1d20. On a 20, the terrain rumbles and spits up lava from a point within 4d4-4 ft of a creature. Each creature within 15 ft of the lava spout makes a DC 20 DEX saving throw or are hit by the lava. A creature in the same square as the lava has disadvantage on its save.
	- 
##### Muffle Moss 
A dark green moss with a faintly minty aroma. It only grows in the [[Whispering Vale]] and the [[Ethereal Veil]]. The moss can delay memory loss due to the [[Whispering Mists]]. Chewing the moss allows a creature to make a DC 8 INT saving throw, reducing the chances of memories being lost. The moss grows in small patches and can be harvested for 1d4 doses. Each dose lasts 2d20 hrs. In addition to delaying memory loss the muffle moss will also silence any footsteps of those walking on it.
