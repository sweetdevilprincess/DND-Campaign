**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1 d 8 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 1 d 12 necrotic damage.

**_At Higher Levels._** The spell's damage increases by one die when you reach 5 th level (2 d 8 or 2 d 12), 11 th level (3 d 8 or 3 d 12), and 17 th level (4 d 8 or 4 d 12).
