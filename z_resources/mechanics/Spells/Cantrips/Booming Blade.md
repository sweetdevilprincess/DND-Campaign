**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (5-foot radius)  
**Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)  
**Duration:** 1 round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 1 d 8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.

**_At Higher Levels._** At 5 th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1 d 8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2 d 8. Both damage rolls increase by 1 d 8 at 11 th level (2 d 8 and 3 d 8) and again at 17 th level (3 d 8 and 4 d 8).
