**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a living flea)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes 1 d 6 poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d 4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

**_At Higher Levels._** The spell's damage increases by 1 d 6 when you reach 5 th level (2 d 6), 11 th level (3 d 6), and 17 th level (4 d 6).
