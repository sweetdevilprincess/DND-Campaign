Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1 d 8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**_At Higher Levels._** The spell's damage increases by 1 d 8 when you reach 5 th level (2 d 8), 11 th level (3 d 8), and 17 th level (4 d 8).
