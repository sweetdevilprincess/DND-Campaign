**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (5-foot radius)  
**Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

**_At Higher Levels._** At 5 th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1 d 8 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1 d 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1 d 8 at 11 th level (2 d 8 and 2 d 8) and 17 th level (3 d 8 and 3 d 8).
