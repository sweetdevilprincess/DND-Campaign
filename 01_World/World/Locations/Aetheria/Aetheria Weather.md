## Base Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Temperature | Varies by season (base 60°F/15°C, cooler than lands below) |
| Wind Speed | Varies (0-10 scale, generally higher than surface) |
| Magical Saturation | Varies (1-10 scale, affects weather phenomena) |

## Daily Roll (d 100)

### 1-50: Mild Weather
- 1-20: Clear skies (no precipitation, wind speed 3-5)
- 21-35: Light crystal mists (slight magical effects)
- 36-45: Gentle breezes (wind speed 5-7)
- 46-50: Partly cloudy (no precipitation)

### 51-80: Moderate Weather
- 51-60: Growth clouds (enhance plant growth, light precipitation)
- 61-70: Crystal showers (refracting light, magical residue)
- 71-75: Windstorm (wind speed 8-10)
- 76-80: Magical fog (obscures vision, enhances magical effects)

### 81-95: Intense Weather
- 81-85: Luminous storm (electrical storm with magical properties)
- 86-90: Gravity squall (fluctuating gravity, strong winds)
- 91-95: Anti-magic cloud bank (nullifies magical effects)

### 96-100: Extreme or Rare Weather Events
- 96: Crystal typhoon (intense storm with Sunfire Crystal energy)
- 97: Planar storm (weather patterns from other planes manifest)
- 98: Void pocket (area of absolute stillness and magical nullification)
- 99: Elemental tempest (storm embodying multiple elemental forces)
- 100: Reality storm (weather warps physical laws temporarily)

## Seasonal Adjustments

> [!info] Spring (80 days)
> - Increasing frequency of growth clouds
> - Rising temperatures and magical saturation
> - Crystal showers more common

> [!info] Summer (80 days)
> - Peak temperatures and magical saturation
> - Frequent luminous storms
> - Highest Sunfire Crystal activity

> [!info] Fall (80 days)
> - Increasing wind speeds
> - Falling temperatures and magical saturation
> - More frequent gravity fluctuations

> [!info] Winter (80 days)
> - Lowest temperatures, potential for snow
> - Formation of frost crystals with magical properties
> - Reduced magical saturation, reliance on stored energy

## Magical Cycle Effects

Apply based on current phase:
- Normal Magic: No additional effects
- Dissipating Magic: 25% chance of reducing Magical Saturation by 1 daily
- No Magic: 50% chance of clear, unnaturally still weather
- Restoring Magic: 25% chance of increasing Magical Saturation by 1 daily, 10% chance of rare weather event

## Notes

> [!note]
> - Weather can vary significantly between different altitudes
> - Sunfire Crystal activity greatly influences local weather patterns
> - Gravity fluctuations can affect precipitation and cloud formation
> - Weather events can sometimes affect the regions below Aetheria

## Using This Table

1. Start with the base conditions for the current season.
2. Each day, roll d 100 and apply the weather effects.
3. Consider the season and altitude when interpreting results.
4. Apply any relevant magical cycle effects.
5. Note how weather interacts with Sunfire Crystals and floating island terrain.
6. Be aware of how weather might affect island buoyancy and inter-island travel.
