## Base Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Crystal Energy | Varies (1-10 scale, 10 being highest) |
| Gravity Stability | Varies (1-10 scale, 10 being most stable) |
| Magical Resonance | Varies (1-10 scale, based on magical activity) |

## Daily Roll (d 100)

### 1-60: Common Aetheria Conditions
- 1-20: Stable conditions (no change)
- 21-30: Slight increase in Crystal Energy (+1, max 10)
- 31-40: Slight decrease in Crystal Energy (-1, min 1)
- 41-50: Minor gravity fluctuation (Gravity Stability ±1)
- 51-60: Shift in Magical Resonance (±1)

### 61-85: Moderate Aetheria Phenomena
- 61-65: Crystal flare (Crystal Energy +2 for 1 d 4 hours)
- 66-70: Low gravity pocket (Gravity Stability -2 in localized area)
- 71-75: Magical eddy (Magical Resonance +2 in small area)
- 76-80: Island drift (subtle movement of floating landmasses)
- 81-85: Aurora borealis (beautiful light show, enhances magical effects)

### 86-95: Intense Aetheria Events
- 86-88: Gravity storm (Gravity Stability fluctuates wildly for 1 d 4 hours)
- 89-91: Crystal surge (Crystal Energy maxed, potential overloads)
- 92-94: Magical vortex (Magical Resonance maxed, unpredictable effects)
- 95: Reality ripple (brief visual distortions, potential planar overlap)

### 96-100: Rare Magical Occurrences
- 96: Spontaneous island formation (new small landmass appears)
- 97: Temporal flux (small area experiences time differently for 1 d 4 hours)
- 98: Elemental manifestation (air or crystal elemental appears briefly)
- 99: Crystal bloom (rapid growth of Sunfire Crystal formations)
- 100: Planar window (temporary glimpse into another plane of existence)

## Seasonal Adjustments

> [!info] Spring (80 days)
> - Crystal Energy: Starting at 6, increasing to 8
> - Gravity Stability: 7-9 (fairly stable)
> - Magical Resonance: 6-8 (increasing with growth clouds)

> [!info] Summer (80 days)
> - Crystal Energy: 8-10 (peak energy absorption)
> - Gravity Stability: 8-10 (most stable)
> - Magical Resonance: 7-9 (high activity)

> [!info] Fall (80 days)
> - Crystal Energy: Starting at 8, decreasing to 6
> - Gravity Stability: 6-8 (increasing fluctuations)
> - Magical Resonance: 6-8 (variable)

> [!info] Winter (80 days)
> - Crystal Energy: 4-6 (lowest, relying on stored energy)
> - Gravity Stability: 5-7 (least stable)
> - Magical Resonance: 5-7 (crystallized magic in frost)

## Magical Cycle Effects

Apply based on current phase:
- Normal Magic: No additional effects
- Dissipating Magic: 25% chance of Crystal Energy and Magical Resonance decreasing by 1 daily
- No Magic: 50% chance of Gravity Stability decreasing by 1 daily
- Restoring Magic: 25% chance of all values increasing by 1 daily, 10% chance of Rare Magical Occurrence

## Notes

> [!note]
> - Crystal Energy affects island buoyancy, magical potency, and local climate
> - Gravity Stability influences movement, architecture, and potential hazards
> - Magical Resonance affects spell potency, magical creature behavior, and planar stability
> - Altitude of islands can significantly impact local conditions

## Using This Table

1. Start with the base conditions for the current season.
2. Each day, roll d 100 and apply the effects.
3. Track Crystal Energy, Gravity Stability, and Magical Resonance changes.
4. Apply seasonal adjustments gradually over each 80-day season.
5. Consider the current phase of the magical cycle and apply those effects.
6. Note how regional effects interact with local ecosystems and inhabitants.
