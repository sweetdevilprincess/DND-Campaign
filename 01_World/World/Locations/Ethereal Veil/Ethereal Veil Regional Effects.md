## Base Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Mist Density | Varies (1-10 scale, 10 being densest) |
| Water Level | Varies (1-10 scale, 10 being highest) |
| Magical Resonance | Varies (1-10 scale, based on magical activity) |

## Daily Roll (d 100)

### 1-60: Common Ethereal Veil Conditions
- 1-20: Stable conditions (no change)
- 21-30: Slight increase in mist density (+1, max 10)
- 31-40: Slight decrease in mist density (-1, min 1)
- 41-50: Minor fluctuation in water level (±1)
- 51-60: Subtle shift in magical resonance (±1)

### 61-85: Moderate Ethereal Veil Phenomena
- 61-65: Mist tide (Mist Density fluctuates by 1 d 4 over the day)
- 66-70: Aetherian shower (Water Level +2 in localized area)
- 71-75: Swamp lights (bioluminescent display, Magical Resonance +2)
- 76-80: Floating vegetation bloom (brief burst of mystical plant growth)
- 81-85: Phantom sounds (ethereal whispers or distant melodies)

### 86-95: Intense Ethereal Veil Events
- 86-88: Mist vortex (rapidly swirling mists, disorienting effect)
- 89-91: Sudden water level shift (Water Level ±3, affects large area)
- 92-94: Magical surge (Magical Resonance maxed for 1 d 4 hours)
- 95: Reality ripple (brief visual distortions, potential planar overlap)

### 96-100: Rare Magical Occurrences
- 96: Ethereal window (glimpse into Aetheria or another plane)
- 97: Spontaneous portal (temporary connection to a random location)
- 98: Time pocket (small area experiences time differently for 1 d 4 hours)
- 99: Mist solidification (mist briefly becomes walkable)
- 100: Swamp awakening (surrounding area shows signs of sentience)

## Seasonal Adjustments

> [!info] Spring (80 days)
> - Water Level: Starting at 5, increasing to 7
> - Mist Density: 6-8 (variable)
> - Magical Resonance: 5-7 (increasing with new growth)

> [!info] Summer (80 days)
> - Water Level: 7-9 (high due to Aetheria runoff)
> - Mist Density: 8-10 (densest)
> - Magical Resonance: 7-9 (peak activity)

> [!info] Fall (80 days)
> - Water Level: Starting at 7, decreasing to 5
> - Mist Density: 5-7 (thinning in some areas)
> - Magical Resonance: 6-8 (fluctuating)

> [!info] Winter (80 days)
> - Water Level: 4-6 (lowest)
> - Mist Density: 4-6 (thinnest, but still significant)
> - Magical Resonance: 4-6 (most stable)

## Magical Cycle Effects

Apply based on current phase:
- Normal Magic: No additional effects
- Dissipating Magic: 25% chance of Mist Density and Magical Resonance decreasing by 1 daily
- No Magic: 50% chance of all values stabilizing (no changes) for 1 d 4 days
- Restoring Magic: 25% chance of Mist Density and Magical Resonance increasing by 1 daily, 10% chance of Rare Magical Occurrence

## Notes

> [!note]
> - Mist Density affects visibility and the ease of navigation
> - Water Level changes can reveal or submerge paths and landmarks
> - Magical Resonance influences the behavior of magical creatures and the potency of spells
> - Aetheria's shadow patterns can create microclimates within the region

## Using This Table

1. Start with the base conditions for the current season.
2. Each day, roll d 100 and apply the effects.
3. Track Mist Density, Water Level, and Magical Resonance changes.
4. Apply seasonal adjustments gradually over each 80-day season.
5. Consider the current phase of the magical cycle and apply those effects.
6. Note how regional effects interact with local ecosystems and inhabitants.
