## Base Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Temperature | Varies by season and elevation (base 30°F/-1°C at mid-elevations) |
| Wind Speed | Varies (0-5 scale, 5 being strongest) |
| Precipitation | Varies (None, Light, Moderate, Heavy) |

## Daily Roll (d 100)

### 1-50: Mild Weather (for Glimmering Peaks)
- 1-20: Clear and cold (no precipitation, wind speed 0-1)
- 21-35: Light snowfall (temperature -5°F, wind speed 1-2)
- 36-45: Partly cloudy (no precipitation, wind speed 2-3)
- 46-50: Sunny but frigid (temperature -10°F, wind speed 0-1)

### 51-80: Moderate Weather
- 51-60: Steady snowfall (temperature -5°F, wind speed 2-3)
- 61-70: Icy winds (temperature -15°F, wind speed 4)
- 71-75: Sleet (mixed snow and rain, temperature near freezing)
- 76-80: Snow squall (brief intense snowfall, wind speed 4)

### 81-95: Intense Weather
- 81-85: Blizzard (heavy snow, temperature -20°F, wind speed 5)
- 86-90: Ice storm (freezing rain, severe ice buildup)
- 91-95: Whiteout conditions (zero visibility, wind speed 5)

### 96-100: Extreme or Rare Weather Events
- 96: Diamond dust (suspended ice crystals, magical light effects)
- 97: Thunder snow (snowstorm with lightning, rare and intense)
- 98: Cyclonic snow devil (localized spinning snow column)
- 99: Föhn storm (rapid warming, intense winds, avalanche risk)
- 100: Magical blizzard (heavy snow with unpredictable magical effects)

## Seasonal Adjustments

> [!info] Winter (100-120 days, can extend to 140-160 days)
> - Increased chance of blizzards and extreme cold
> - Higher average wind speeds
> - Precipitation almost always snow

> [!info] Spring (60-80 days, can be shortened by extended winter)
> - More variable weather, mixing snow and rain
> - Increased avalanche risk
> - Gradually decreasing wind speeds

> [!info] Summer (60-80 days)
> - Possibility of rain instead of snow at lower elevations
> - Clearer days, but still cold
> - Chance of afternoon thunderstorms

> [!info] Fall (60-80 days)
> - Rapidly increasing chance of snowfall
> - Return of stronger winds
> - More frequent storm systems

## Magical Cycle Effects

Apply based on current phase:
- Normal Magic: No additional effects
- Dissipating Magic: 25% chance of weather intensifying (e.g., heavier snow, stronger winds)
- No Magic: 50% chance of eerily calm weather, regardless of season
- Restoring Magic: 25% chance of rapid weather shifts, 10% chance of rare weather event

## Notes

> [!note]
> - Weather severity generally increases with elevation
> - Sudden weather changes are common and can be dangerous
> - "Mild" weather in Glimmering Peaks may still be extreme by other standards
> - Weather interacts with the Glimmering effect, potentially creating unique visual phenomena

## Using This Table

1. Start with the base conditions for the current season and elevation.
2. Each day, roll d 100 and apply the weather effects.
3. Consider the season and elevation when interpreting results.
4. Apply any relevant magical cycle effects.
5. Note how weather interacts with the mountainous terrain and magical environment.
6. Be aware of potential hazards like avalanches or ice formation.
