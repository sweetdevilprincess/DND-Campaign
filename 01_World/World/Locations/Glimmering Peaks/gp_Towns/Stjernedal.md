Known to travelers as Skyward Haven, Stjernedal nestles within a protected valley of the Glimmering Peaks, where unique atmospheric conditions create exceptionally clear views of the night sky. The settlement's architecture harmoniously blends with the natural landscape - buildings seem to grow from the valley walls, their towers topped with astronomical observatories. Hanging gardens cascade down the valley sides, and carefully positioned mirrors reflect sunlight to illuminate the valley floor.

The population consists primarily of scholars, artists, and spiritual seekers from various races. Elves and humans form the majority, with significant numbers of gnomes drawn to the astronomical research. The local dialect incorporates many terms related to stars, weather patterns, and philosophical concepts.
