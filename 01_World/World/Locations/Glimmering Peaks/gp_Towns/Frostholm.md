Nestled amidst the snowy peaks of the Glimmering Peaks, Frostholm stands as a testament to those who have mastered living with eternal ice and snow. The town is built from massive blocks of magically-preserved ice and stone, with buildings featuring elaborate frost patterns that naturally form in the intense cold. Steam rises from various chimneys and vents, creating an ever-present crystalline mist that freezes into delicate ice formations across the town's surfaces.

The population consists mainly of dwarves, humans, and goliaths who have adapted to the extreme cold, along with a small but significant community of ice genasi. The local dialect includes dozens of words for different types of snow and ice conditions, and their craft-terminology is equally specific regarding ice-working techniques.
