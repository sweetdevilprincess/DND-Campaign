Founded by Aarakocra settlers generations ago, Ornvakt rises from the western cliffs of the Glimmering Peaks in a series of circular tiers reminiscent of a massive nest. The architecture blends Aarakocra design principles with practical mountain engineering - buildings feature sweeping curves and open spaces, with retractable canopies that can be deployed during storms. Wyvern roosts dot the upper cliffs, their residents' calls echoing through the carefully designed acoustic channels that help regulate wind flow through the settlement.

The population reflects its unique heritage: a substantial Aarakocra and Owlin community lives alongside humans, goliaths, kenku, dwarves and air genasi who have adapted to the aerial lifestyle. Many buildings feature multiple entry points at different heights to accommodate both flying and ground-dwelling residents. The local dialect includes many Aarakocra terms, particularly relating to wind patterns, wyvern behavior, and aerial navigation.
