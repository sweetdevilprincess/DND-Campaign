Known to outsiders as Sapphire Ridge, **Steinkrone** crowns the eastern peaks of the Glimmering Peaks like a jeweled diadem. The settlement is built in concentric tiers carved directly into the mountain's crown, with the famous sapphire mines beneath and the nobles' quarters glittering at the summit. Elaborate stone archways and buttresses support each level, their surfaces inlaid with veins of sapphire that catch the light and create stunning blue reflections throughout the city.

The population consists primarily of dwarves and humans, with a growing community of earth genasi drawn to the unique mineral properties of the area. Goliaths serve as vital members of the mining operations, while gnomes are highly valued for their gem-cutting expertise. The local dialect is rich with specialized terms for different types of stones, mining conditions, and gem qualities.
