Known to outsiders as Stardust Hamlet, Lysfall clings to the cliffs surrounding the [[Enchanted Cascade]], where the frozen peaks give way to the mystical waters of [[Veilwater Lake]] below. The settlement's architecture reflects its precarious position - buildings near the peak feature ice-reinforced walls, while those closer to the falls incorporate flowing designs that channel the constant mist. Ancient symbols, their meanings known only to certain families, are subtly worked into the architecture throughout the town.

The population consists mainly of those who have learned to live in harmony with both the healing waters and their dangerous neighbors below. Many residents bear marking pins that denote their role in the community's traditions. The local dialect includes numerous terms for different types of water flows, ice formations, and most importantly, various states of knowledge and memory.
