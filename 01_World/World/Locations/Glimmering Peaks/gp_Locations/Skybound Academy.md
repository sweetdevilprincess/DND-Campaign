## Overview
Founded by Aarakocra settlers generations ago, the Academy has evolved into a prestigious institution where humans, Aarakocra, and other races learn the ancient art of wyvern bonding and riding.

## The Bonding Process

### Initial Selection
- Young wyverns choose their potential riders around their third year of life
- Candidates spend time in the "greeting grounds" - special areas where young wyverns can observe them
- Wyverns indicate their choice by sharing food with their chosen rider
- Some wyverns never choose riders, remaining wild but allied to Ornvakt
- If a wyvern doesn't choose you, you cannot become a rider, no matter your skill or status

### Training Stages
