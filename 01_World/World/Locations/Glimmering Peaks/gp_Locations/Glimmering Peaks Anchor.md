# The Frost Nexus

 **Takes 3 hrs from the nearest town to reach the opening of the cave.** *roll for exhaustion every 1 hr*

After traveling for hours, you see a see icy rock and stone give way to a large cave opening. The entrance looks dark, even to those of you who can see well in the dark.
As you approach then opening the icy wind almost seems to cut into you deeper, though the snowflakes almost seem to fall slower.
Entering the cave the cold wind no longer feels as though it is cutting into your skin. The cave feels quite warm in comparison to outside. 
As you delve deeper and deeper into the cave, the warmth slowly comes back to your fingers and toes, and while you are still tired and worn from the trek here. You are more relaxed. 
Finally, you come to a large opening, you see spires of pale blue crystals and ice, all pointing toward the center of the cavern. 
In the center sits a large waterfall, though this waterfall seems to be frozen in time, flowing upward. **Upon closer inspection, you can see something spiraling up the waterfall** *DC 16 from entrance to see stairs*
You all hear a soft ringing, like windchimes echoing though the room. Looking upward, directly above the waterfall crystals form a majority of the ceiling allowing rainbow light to shine into the cavern. 

As you approach waterfall, you see that it is in fact, not frozen. It seems to move and shift slightly little waves. 
**If someone touches the waterfall roll on the [[waterfall table]] to see what happens.**

Moving upward you see runes carved into the spiraling stairs. **Runes say stuff in language**
