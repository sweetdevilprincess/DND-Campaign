## Base Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Temperature | Varies by season and elevation (base 30°F/-1°C at mid-elevations) |
| Snow Cover | Varies (0-10 scale, 10 being deepest) |
| Glimmering Intensity | Varies (1-10 scale, based on magical activity) |

## Daily Roll (d 100)

### 1-60: Common Glimmering Peaks Conditions
- 1-20: Stable conditions (no change)
- 21-30: Slight increase in snow cover (+1, max 10)
- 31-40: Slight decrease in snow cover (-1, min 0)
- 41-50: Minor glimmering effect (+1 intensity, max 10)
- 51-60: Glacial creaking (no effect, but ominous atmosphere)

### 61-85: Moderate Glimmering Peaks Phenomena
- 61-65: Ice crystal formation (beautiful patterns, slippery surfaces)
- 66-70: Localized avalanche (small-scale, potential hazard)
- 71-75: Föhn wind event (sudden warming, +10°F for 1 d 4 hours)
- 76-80: Glimmering surge (Glimmering Intensity +2 for 1 d 4 hours)
- 81-85: Frost quakes (loud booms, minor tremors)

### 86-95: Intense Glimmering Peaks Events
- 86-88: Major avalanche (significant hazard, reshapes local terrain)
- 89-91: Extreme cold snap (temperature drops 20°F for 1 d 4 days)
- 92-94: Glacier shift (changes in ice formations, potential new passages)
- 95: Magnetic anomaly (compasses malfunction, magical effects amplified)

### 96-100: Rare Magical Occurrences
- 96: Temporal frost (area temporarily out of sync with normal time flow)
- 97: Crystalline growth (rapid formation of magical ice structures)
- 98: Aurora event (breathtaking lights, temporary boost to magic)
- 99: Elemental manifestation (brief appearance of ice/air elemental)
- 100: Peak awakening (mountain briefly shows signs of sentience)

## Seasonal Adjustments

> [!info] Winter (100-120 days, can extend to 140-160 days)
> - Temperature: Base -20°F to -40°F
> - Snow Cover: Starting at 7, increasing to 10
> - Glimmering Intensity: 6-8 (brightest during darkest months)

> [!info] Spring (60-80 days, can be shortened by extended winter)
> - Temperature: Base -10°F to +20°F
> - Snow Cover: Starting at 10, decreasing to 5
> - Glimmering Intensity: 4-6 (fluctuating with melt patterns)

> [!info] Summer (60-80 days)
> - Temperature: Base +30°F to +50°F
> - Snow Cover: 3-5 (higher at greater elevations)
> - Glimmering Intensity: 2-4 (dimmed by increased sunlight)

> [!info] Fall (60-80 days)
> - Temperature: Base +20°F to -10°F
> - Snow Cover: Starting at 3, increasing to 7
> - Glimmering Intensity: 4-6 (increasing as nights lengthen)

## Magical Cycle Effects

Apply based on current phase:
- Normal Magic: No additional effects
- Dissipating Magic: 25% chance of temperature dropping 5°F daily, Snow Cover +1
- No Magic: 50% chance of Glimmering Intensity dropping to 0 for 1 d 4 days
- Restoring Magic: 25% chance of temperature fluctuating ±10°F, 10% chance of Rare Magical Occurrence

## Notes

> [!note]
> - Temperature changes are relative to the base temperature of 30°F (-1°C) at mid-elevations
> - Snow Cover affects travel difficulty and avalanche risk
> - Glimmering Intensity influences visibility, magical effects, and creature behavior
> - Extended winters can dramatically alter seasonal patterns and durations

## Using This Table

1. Start with the base conditions for the current season and elevation.
2. Each day, roll d 100 and apply the effects.
3. Track Temperature, Snow Cover, and Glimmering Intensity changes.
4. Apply seasonal adjustments gradually over each season.
5. Consider the current phase of the magical cycle and apply those effects.
6. Note how regional effects interact with local ecosystems and inhabitants.
