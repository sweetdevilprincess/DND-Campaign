## Base Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Light Level | Constant brightness (1-10 scale, based on bioluminescence intensity) |
| Temperature | Varies by region (North warmer, South more temperate) |
| Humidity | Varies (North drier, South more humid) |

## Daily Roll (d 100)

### 1-50: Common Weather
- 1-15: Clear day, steady bioluminescence
- 16-25: Light breeze, slight fluctuation in light intensity
- 26-35: Passing clouds (affects sunlight, not bioluminescence)
- 36-45: Mild temperature increase (+5°F)
- 46-50: Mild temperature decrease (-5°F)

### 51-80: Moderate Weather
- 51-60: Light rain (southern regions)
- 61-65: Dry spell (northern regions)
- 66-70: Gusty winds
- 71-75: Foggy conditions (glowing fog in some areas)
- 76-80: Bioluminescent flare (Light Level +2 for 1 d 4 hours)

### 81-95: Intense Weather
- 81-85: Thunderstorm (southern regions)
- 86-88: Heat wave (especially near volcanic areas, +10°F)
- 89-91: Cold snap (especially in higher elevations, -10°F)
- 92-94: Bioluminescent storm (rapid light fluctuations)
- 95: Volcanic activity (tremors, ash in northern regions)

### 96-100: Extreme or Rare Weather Events
- 96: "Light snow" (glowing particles falling, only in winter and high elevations)
- 97: Intense geothermal activity (hot springs overflowing, steam vents)
- 98: Bioluminescent blackout (Light Level drops to 1 for 1 d 4 hours)
- 99: Aurora-like phenomenon (magical light display in the sky)
- 100: Crystalstorm (shards of bioluminescent material carried by wind)

## Seasonal Adjustments

> [!info] Spring (Days 1-80)
> - Gradual warming trend
> - Increasing Light Level (7 to 8)
> - More frequent light rain in the south

> [!info] Summer (Days 81-160)
> - Peak temperatures
> - Highest Light Level (9 to 10)
> - Dry in the north, occasional thunderstorms in the south

> [!info] Fall (Days 161-240)
> - Cooling trend
> - Decreasing Light Level (8 to 7)
> - Increased rainfall, especially in the south

> [!info] Winter (Days 241-320)
> - Coolest temperatures (still mild compared to other regions)
> - Lowest Light Level (6 to 7)
> - Increased chance of fog and mist

## Magical Cycle Effects

Apply based on current phase:

- Normal Magic: No additional effects
- Dissipating Magic: 25% chance of Light Level decrease (-1) daily
- No Magic: 50% chance of bioluminescent blackout
- Restoring Magic: 25% chance of Light Level increase (+1) daily, 10% chance of rare light phenomenon

## Regional Variations

> [!note]
> - Northern Lumina: +5°F to base temperature, 25% less chance of precipitation
> - Southern Lumina: -5°F to base temperature, 25% more chance of precipitation
> - Coastal Areas: Increased humidity, sea breezes moderate temperature extremes
> - Higher Elevations: -10°F to base temperature, increased chance of "light snow" in winter

## Notes

> [!note]
> - Light Level affects visibility, plant growth, and creature behavior
> - Temperature changes are temporary unless noted, returning to baseline over 1 d 4 days
> - Volcanic activity in the north can cause localized weather changes
> - "False nights" of dimmed bioluminescence may occur randomly (10% chance daily)

## Using This Table

1. Start with the base conditions, adjusting for the specific region within Lumina.
2. Each day, roll d 100 and apply the weather effects.
3. Consider the season and adjust probabilities or effects accordingly.
4. Apply any relevant magical cycle effects.
5. Note how weather interacts with the bioluminescent environment and affects daily life.
