Located south of [[Emberreach]] near the outskirts of the [[Whispering Vale]] in the [[Lumina]] region, Radiant Hollow is well known for its luminous, stunning architecture. The town features elegant structures adorned with intricate carvings and vibrant stained glass windows. The buildings are designed to capture and reflect sunlight, giving the town a radiant and ethereal appearance. The carvings are said to lead the way to the entrance of the underground black market.

Despite its outward appearance of prosperity and orderliness, Radiant Hollow harbors a hidden underbelly where illicit activities thrive. While the majority of the town's population is oblivious to the existence of the underground network, whispers of its existence circulate among those more familiar with the town's secrets.

The prominent races are: Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Half-Elves, Dragonborn, Half-Orcs, and Orcs. There are also a few Goliaths, Tabaxi, Aarakocra, Gnomes, Halflings, and Tieflings residing here.
