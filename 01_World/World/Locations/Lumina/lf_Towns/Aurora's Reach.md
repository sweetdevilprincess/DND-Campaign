# Leaving Town

As travelers depart Aurora's Reach, they're treated to a spectacular view of the aurora-like lights that give the town its name. These magical lights seem to dance in the sky, guiding travelers on their way and serving as a beacon for those seeking to return.

The road leading away from Aurora's Reach gradually transitions from the serene village atmosphere to the wider Lumina Fields, with the glow of the town slowly fading behind travelers as they venture forth into new adventures.
