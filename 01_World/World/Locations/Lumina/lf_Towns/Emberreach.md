Situated in the Northern region of [[Lumina]] near the [[Ember Caverns]] and on the outskirts of a dormant volcano, Emberreach is a mining town built around the extraction and trade of [[Sunfire Crystal]]s. The townsfolk are hardy miners and craftsmen who harness the geothermal energy of the volcano and the [[Sunfire Crystal]]s. The town's architecture features structures adorned with intricate patterns reminiscent of flickering flames. 
The prominent races here are: Fire Genasi, Dragonborn, Azer, Tiefling, Orcs, Dwarves, Giants, and various mixed races.

	This town is essentially where the Aasimar send people that are making too much trouble for them. They are sent here to work, those that are sent here are not allowed out of the volcano. The Aasimar try to portray this area as an area that welcomes those that are "Hot-blooded" so that it is more comfortable for them. While it is, they try to keep the fact that it is essentially a prison tightly under wraps.
