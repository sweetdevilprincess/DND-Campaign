## Base Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Light Level | Varies (1-10 scale, based on bioluminescence intensity) |
| Temperature | Varies by season and location (base 70°F/21°C) |
| Humidity | Varies (40-80%, higher in the south and coast) |

## Daily Roll (d 100)

### 1-60: Common Lumina Conditions
- 1-20: Stable bioluminescence (no change)
- 21-30: Slight increase in light intensity (+1, max 10)
- 31-40: Slight decrease in light intensity (-1, min 1)
- 41-50: Localized light flare (temporary +2 in small area)
- 51-60: Minor geothermal activity (slight temperature increase)

### 61-85: Moderate Lumina Phenomena
- 61-65: Light wave (rippling patterns of intensity across the region)
- 66-70: Glowing fog (reduced visibility, enchanting atmosphere)
- 71-75: Heat mirage (visual distortions, especially near volcano)
- 76-80: Bioluminescent pollen release (potential for allergic reactions)
- 81-85: Geothermal vent activation (localized heat and steam)

### 86-95: Intense Lumina Events
- 86-88: Light storm (intense, pulsating bioluminescence for 1 d 4 hours)
- 89-91: Volcanic tremor (minor quake, increased geothermal activity)
- 92-94: Bioluminescent surge (Light Level maxed for 1 d 4 hours)
- 95: Temporal light flux (rapid cycling of light intensity)

### 96-100: Rare Magical Occurrences
- 96: Living light (bioluminescence seems to move with purpose)
- 97: Light absorption (small area becomes unnaturally dark)
- 98: Crystalline growth (rapid formation of light-storing crystals)
- 99: Aurora phenomenon (colorful light display in the sky)
- 100: Photonic anomaly (light behaves in physically impossible ways)

## Seasonal Adjustments

> [!info] Spring (Days 1-80)
> - Starting Light Level: 6, increasing to 8
> - Temperature: Base +0°F, increasing to +5°F
> - Humidity: Slight increase, more in south

> [!info] Summer (Days 81-160)
> - Light Level: 8-10 (peak intensity)
> - Temperature: Base +5°F to +10°F
> - Humidity: Lowest in north, highest in south

> [!info] Fall (Days 161-240)
> - Starting Light Level: 8, decreasing to 6
> - Temperature: Base +5°F, decreasing to +0°F
> - Humidity: Gradual increase, especially in south

> [!info] Winter (Days 241-320)
> - Light Level: 4-6 (dimmest, but still bright)
> - Temperature: Base -5°F to +0°F
> - Humidity: Highest, potential for glowing fog

## Magical Cycle Effects

Apply based on current phase:
- Normal Magic: No additional effects
- Dissipating Magic: 25% chance of -1 to Light Level daily
- No Magic: 50% chance of Light Level dropping to 1 for 1 d 4 hours
- Restoring Magic: 25% chance of +1 to Light Level daily, 10% chance of Rare Magical Occurrence

## Notes

> [!note]
> - Temperature changes are relative to the base temperature of 70°F (21°C)
> - Light Level affects visibility, plant growth, and creature behavior
> - Volcanic activity in the north can cause localized temperature spikes
> - Coastal areas may experience more moderate temperatures due to sea breezes

## Using This Table

1. Start with the base conditions for the current season.
2. Each day, roll d 100 and apply the effects.
3. Track Light Level, Temperature, and Humidity changes.
4. Apply seasonal adjustments gradually over each 80-day season.
5. Consider the current phase of the magical cycle and apply those effects.
6. Note how regional effects interact with local ecosystems and inhabitants.
