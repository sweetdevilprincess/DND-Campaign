## Crimson Shores Concept:

- Similar to Palau tropical moist forests
- Environment: A striking coastline where iron-rich red waters meet tropical marshlands and dormant volcanic formations
- The water's crimson color comes from high iron content, creating "bloodwater falls" where freshwater meets the iron-rich sea
- Mangrove-like trees with adapted root systems that filter the iron-rich water, their bark taking on a deep reddish hue
- Steam vents and hot springs scattered throughout, where volcanic activity meets marshland
- Unique ecosystem adapted to the high iron content and volcanic conditions

## Anchor Point
- Located where volcanic activity, iron-rich waters, and marsh energies converge
- Housed in an ancient temple partially submerged in the red waters
- The high iron content could represent the "blood" of the world, making this anchor point symbolic of life force and vitality
