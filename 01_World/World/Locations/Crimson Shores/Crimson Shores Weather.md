## Seasonal Adjustments

> [!info] Spring (80 days)
> - Increasing frequency of red-tinted rains
> - Gradually rising temperatures and humidity

> [!info] Summer (80 days)
> - Peak temperatures and humidity
> - Frequent afternoon thunderstorms
> - Highest risk of tropical storms or hurricanes

> [!info] Fall (80 days)
> - Gradually decreasing temperatures
> - Reduced rainfall, but still humid
> - Increased volcanic activity may affect weather

> [!info] Winter (80 days)
> - Mildest temperatures (but still warm)

## Using This Table

1. Start with the base conditions for the current season.
2. Each day, roll d 100 and apply the weather effects.
3. Consider the season and proximity to volcanic areas when interpreting results.
4. Apply any relevant magical cycle effects.
5. Note how weather interacts with the unique environment of Crimson Shores.
6. Be aware of potential health hazards from mineral-rich precipitation or ash.
