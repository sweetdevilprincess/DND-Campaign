Deep in the [[Whispering Vale]] lies Misthaven.
Establishments here are [[#Twisted Yew]], [[#Cryptic Cauldron]], [[#Shade 's Embrace]], [[#Veiled Masquerade]], [[#Cursed Coffer]]. 

You see faint lights ahead of you. You can tell that these lights are different than the ones that you have been experiencing in the forest thus far. You can tell that these lights lead to a town. As you approach you feel a heavy weight on your chest. The soft rustling of leaves seems to stop suddenly, the air around you is completely silent and though there is no wind, you can almost feel a whisper brush along your skin. The air itself feels heavy as a sense of unease begins creeping up your spine. 
**Roll Perception DC 16**
 - ***Pass***:
	   As you get closer it's as though you can see dark tendrils of mist curling unnaturally around the buildings They seem to recoil from your gaze, as though they do not want to be seen. The Town seems to hum and pulse as though it were alive and breathing, the wood creaking in protest. The unease that you had been feeling a moment ago seems to worsen and you know that you will be on edge while you are here. 
 - ***Fail***:
	   As you get closer you feel as though someone is watching you, then as quickly as it came it is gone making you question whether or not you had the feeling in the first place. Your unease seems dissipate and you begin to feel relief even. You brush off the initial feeling as being in a new town, you have been through a lot the last few days. 
	   
As you pass through the threshold into town you see that the townsfolk seem tired, but nothing really out of the ordinary. You glance around the town seeing wood and stone like every other town that you have been to in this region, though this one seems to not have any carvings, or works of art. You can see that this town has a healthy mix of gnomes, halflings, drow, humans, and tieflings. The townsfolk do not greet you, they simply glance in your direction and continue on. Time seems to pass weird here. It feels as though time moves much slower. **Each day that players spend here 2 days pass**

- ###### Challenges
	- Sinister Harmony: the town thrives within the eerie embrace of the  [[Whispering Vale]], locked in a symbiotic relationship with the forest. The townsfolk are reliant on the supernatural energies of the forest for their existence
	- Shadowy Rituals: sinister rituals and ceremonies take place under the cover of night here. The townsfolk will gather around to watch as the [[Weaver]] sews a thread upon who she deems worthy.
1. **Forbidden Knowledge**: Misthaven Grove is known for harboring ancient tomes and scrolls that hold forbidden knowledge. Those who dare to delve into these dark texts may uncover secrets of dark magic, curses, and forbidden rituals. However, such knowledge comes at a price, as it can taint the soul and bind one closer to the malevolent influence of the Whispering Vale.
    
2. **Shadow Markets**: Within the village, hidden beneath the surface, lies a clandestine marketplace where rare and illicit items are traded. Here, shadowy figures deal in cursed artifacts, dark relics, and potions brewed from ingredients found only within the Whispering Vale. These items hold great power but also carry a heavy price, as they may exact a toll on the user's sanity or morality.
