Nestled deep within the [[Whispering Vale]] lies Shadowglen.
The establishments here are, [[#Shadow's Embrace Inn]], [[#Obsidian Blacksmith]], the [[#Veiled Elixirs]] and [[#Shadowmender]], and  [[#Veilwood Library]]. There is [[#Starlit Plaza & Midnight Bazaar]] in the center of town. There is [[#Coven of Whispered Secrets]] here as well. 

As you approach the village, it appears as though it emerged organically from the forest floor. Wooden houses blend seamlessly with the natural environment, as if they grew from the very trees surrounding them. Moss and Ivy crawl up the sides of the buildings and ethereal glow stones illuminate the pathways, casting an eerie glow that mimics that of the moon. As you look up you realize you can no longer see the sky whatsoever, not even slivers of light through the canopy of leaves. The residents are apprehensive of you but visibly thankful of your help. Looking around you can see that the village consists mostly of Drow, Teiflings, and humans.

### **RIddles**
#### **First Riddle**

		Six sacred groves cry out in pain,
		Their essence stolen, powers wane,
		The price of power one must yield,
		Till magic flows once more to reign.
		
		Not gold nor gems shall mend the blight,
		No mortal treasures burn so bright,
		A power deep within concealed,
		Must flow to make the wrongs set right.
		
		When sacred bonds are forged anew,
		And paths of radiance shine through,
		The ancient secrets are revealed,
		The guardian's truth shall guide you true.
		
		Where living magic weaves its spell,
		In channels deep where powers dwell,
		Your essence freely must be sealed,
		To heal the scars that time befell.
#### **Riddle for the Fairy Queen**


		Once a queen who ruled with care, 
		Now corrupt beyond repair, 
		Where ancient trees once knew her grace, 
		Her children laugh in shadows there.
		
		Her gossamer wings still hold their sway, 
		Commanding swarms in dark display, 
		Her realm of life in disgrace, 
		Where lesser fairies dance and play.
		
		When tattered wings have lost their power, 
		The swarm breaks free in this dark hour, 
		Her wings once spun of golden lace, 
		Can't shield the heart within her tower.
		
		In final throes she guards her core, 
		Though death would end this endless war, 
		Grant her rest, such sweet embrace, 
		And lay her soul upon death's door.

#### **Riddle for the Guardian**

		

## Veilwater Lake
About 3 days travel north. This lake's water is magical with water coming from [[Enchanted Cascade]]. 
You step through the threshold of the trees to see a beautiful lake. Just across the water, you see the high cliffs that you know must be Glimmering Peaks. A waterfall flows down the cliffside with a powerful roar that you can hear from across the lake. The water is nearly crystal clear. As you stare out, you see a small rock island off to one side. The trees line the edges of the water, creating seldom shores. The sight seems to calm you, to relieve you even.

***Notable Features***
 -  [[Bestiary#Melusines|Melusines]] inhabit the area.
