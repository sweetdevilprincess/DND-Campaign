A coven of all types of mystics, warlocks, and witches who seek to understand the mysteries of the [[Whispering Vale]]. They are dedicated to the worship of [[Silvarin]]. 
The head priestess, [[Evelyn Nightshade]] will often communicate with [[Silvarin]]. Their main focus is studying the portals and the doors in the Whispering Vale. They will communicate mostly in Sylvan. 

[[Silvarin]] will take the fae that they are given and sacrifice them to the groves. They do this to try to fill the void of magic there. 

## Future Notes
 - [[Silvarin]] 's plan to fill the void with magic does not work, all it does is make the forest angry with him. He does not know this as he cannot speak with the forest. 
 - [[Silvarin]] is fairly confident that his way is working though taking much longer, and more sacrifices than he had anticipated. If another way is suggested he may be willing to listen.
 - The groves rely on sacrifices of magic, either permanently or temporarily, but for these sacrifices to matter the group has to set other things into motion first. They need to try to find the guardians of the forest.
