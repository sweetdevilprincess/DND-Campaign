# Havenbrook
In the [[Whispering Vale]] between Misthaven and Shadowglen lies Havenbrook. Havenbrook serves as a sanctuary for weary travelers and explorers. It is maintained by a group of druids and rangers that dedicate themselves to keeping balance with the forest. Many of the people that reside here have a strong distaste for those who come from [[Misthaven]] or who participate in the practice of Binding. 

Havenbrook has a unique take on how there town is constructed. They have found a way to manipulate the living trees around them to make their homes and buildings. They have learned to weave the tree branches together. They have also find a way to incorporate some of the glowing moss and plants that are common among the area as natural light sources.
