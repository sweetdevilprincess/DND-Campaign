You step through the threshold of the trees to see a beautiful lake. Just across the water, you see the high cliffs that you know must be Glimmering Peaks. A waterfall flows down the cliffside with a powerful roar that you can hear from across the lake. The water is nearly crystal clear. As you stare out, you see a small rock island off to one side. The trees line the edges of the water, creating seldom shores. The sight seems to calm you, to relieve you even. **Roll Perception DC 13 if failed, roll Charisma Saving Throw DC 15 if failed, [charmed](mechanics.md#charmed)** 


A tranquil and shimmering lake nestled deep within the forest. The lake possesses magical properties, the water is rumored to grant visions and glimpses into the past, present, or future. The water flowing from the [[Enchanted Cascade]] are what gives the lake its properties.
