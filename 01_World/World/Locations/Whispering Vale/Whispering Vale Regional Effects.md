## Base Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Light Level | Varies by season (1-10 scale, 1 being darkest) |
| Fog Density | Varies (1-10 scale, 10 being densest) |
| Bioluminescence Activity | Varies (1-10 scale, 10 being most active) |
| Base Temperature | 60°F (15°C) - relatively stable year-round |

## Daily Roll (d 100)

### 1-60: Common Forest Conditions
- 1-20: No noticeable change
- 21-30: Slight increase in fog density (+1, max 10)
- 31-40: Slight decrease in fog density (-1, min 1)
- 41-50: Increase in bioluminescence activity (+1, max 10)
- 51-60: Decrease in bioluminescence activity (-1, min 1)

### 61-85: Moderate Forest Phenomena
- 61-65: Bioluminescent bloom (Bioluminescence +2 for 1 d 4 days)
- 66-70: Fog pocket (Fog Density +2 in localized area for 1 d 4 days)
- 71-75: Whisper wind (Carries distant sounds, may contain secrets)
- 76-80: Dripping canopy (Increased humidity, slippery surfaces)
- 81-85: Spore release (Potential for hallucinations or minor magical effects)

### 86-95: Intense Forest Events
- 86-88: Sudden canopy shift (Light Level +2 for 1 d 4 days, then returns)
- 89-91: Bioluminescent storm (Bioluminescence at max, flashing patterns)
- 92-94: Fog vortex (Fog Density at max, swirling patterns)
- 95: Whisper cascade (Intense sound phenomenon, may impart knowledge)

### 96-100: Rare Magical Occurrences
- 96: Temporal pocket (Time flows differently in a small area for 1 d 4 days)
- 97: Gravity flux (Localized changes in gravity for 1 d 4 hours)
- 98: Essence bloom (Temporary increase in magical energies, enhances spells)
- 99: Ethereal window (Glimpses into other planes or times visible in fog)
- 100: Forest awakening (Trees and plants show signs of sentience for 1 d 4 hours)

## Seasonal Adjustments

> [!info] Spring (Days 1-80)
> - Starting Light Level: 2, decreasing to 1 by end of season
> - Starting Fog Density: 7, increasing to 8
> - Starting Bioluminescence: 8, increasing to 9

> [!info] Summer (Days 81-160)
> - Light Level: 1 (constant darkness)
> - Starting Fog Density: 8, increasing to 9
> - Starting Bioluminescence: 9, increasing to 10

> [!info] Fall (Days 161-240)
> - Starting Light Level: 1, increasing to 4 by end of season
> - Starting Fog Density: 9, decreasing to 7
> - Starting Bioluminescence: 10, decreasing to 8

> [!info] Winter (Days 241-320)
> - Starting Light Level: 4, increasing to 5 by mid-season, then decreasing
> - Starting Fog Density: 7, decreasing to 6
> - Starting Bioluminescence: 8, decreasing to 7

## Magical Cycle Effects

Apply based on current phase:

- Normal Magic: No additional effects
- Dissipating Magic: 25% chance of -1 to all values daily
- No Magic: 50% chance of -1 to Bioluminescence daily
- Restoring Magic: 25% chance of +1 to all values daily, 10% chance of Rare Magical Occurrence

## Notes

> [!note]
> - Temperature remains relatively stable but can fluctuate ±5°F based on events
> - During Fall and Winter, add a 10% chance of leaf fall increasing Light Level by 1
> - Adjust event probabilities based on season and magical cycle as needed

## Using This Table

1. Start with the base conditions for the current season.
2. Each day, roll d 100 and apply the effects.
3. Keep track of Light Level, Fog Density, and Bioluminescence Activity.
4. Apply seasonal adjustments gradually over the course of each 80-day season.
5. Consider the current phase of the magical cycle and apply those effects as well.
6.
