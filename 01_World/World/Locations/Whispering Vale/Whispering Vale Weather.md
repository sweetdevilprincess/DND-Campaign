## Base Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Temperature | 60°F (15°C) - relatively stable year-round |
| Humidity | Very High (80-100%) |
| Wind | Usually minimal due to dense forest |

## Daily Roll (d 100)

### 1-50: Mild Weather
- 1-20: Misty drizzle (light precipitation, everything damp)
- 21-35: Still air (no noticeable air movement)
- 36-45: Gentle forest breeze (slight rustling of leaves)
- 46-50: Dry spell (relative term in this humid environment)

### 51-80: Moderate Weather
- 51-60: Steady rain (water dripping heavily from canopy)
- 61-70: Cool air pocket (temperature drop of 5°F)
- 71-75: Warm air current (temperature increase of 5°F)
- 76-80: Gusty winds (unusual air movement, fallen leaves and debris)

### 81-95: Intense Weather
- 81-85: Heavy rainstorm (potential for minor flooding on forest floor)
- 86-90: Chilly snap (temperature drop of 10°F, frost on vegetation)
- 91-95: Warm front (temperature increase of 10°F, increased humidity)

### 96-100: Extreme or Rare Weather Events
- 96: Localized whirlwind (spinning leaves and debris, 1 d 4 hours)
- 97: Forest floor flood (heavy rain accumulation, 1 d 4 days to recede)
- 98: Unnatural silence (all weather sounds cease for 1 d 4 hours)
- 99: Pollen storm (thick clouds of pollen, potential allergic reactions)
- 100: Phantom storm (sounds and sensation of a storm, but no actual precipitation)

## Seasonal Adjustments

> [!info] Spring (Days 1-80)
> - Increase chance of rain and warm fronts
> - 5% chance of pollen storms (roll 96-100)

> [!info] Summer (Days 81-160)
> - Higher baseline temperature (+5°F)
> - Increased humidity
> - More frequent warm air currents

> [!info] Fall (Days 161-240)
> - More variable temperatures
> - Increased chance of gusty winds
> - Slight decrease in overall humidity

> [!info] Winter (Days 241-320)
> - Lower baseline temperature (-5°F)
> - Higher chance of chilly snaps
> - Possibility of light snow instead of rain (10% chance when precipitation occurs)

## Magical Cycle Effects

Apply based on current phase:

- Normal Magic: No additional effects
- Dissipating Magic: 25% chance of more extreme temperature fluctuations
- No Magic: 50% chance of unusually still weather (no wind, no precipitation)
- Restoring Magic: 25% chance of random weather event from any category

## Notes

> [!note]
> - Temperature changes are temporary unless otherwise noted, returning to baseline over 1 d 4 days
> - Precipitation in the Vale often manifests as increased dripping from the canopy rather than direct rainfall
> - Severe storms from outside the Vale might be felt as muffled, distant phenomena
> - Weather can affect fog density and bioluminescent activity as per the previous table

## Using This Table

1. Start with the base conditions.
2. Each day, roll d 100 and apply the weather effects.
3. Consider the season and adjust probabilities or effects accordingly.
4. Apply any relevant magical cycle effects.
5. Note how the weather interacts with the forest environment (e.g., how rain manifests through the canopy).
