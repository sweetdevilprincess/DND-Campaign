## Creation

In the beginning was Astrael as one being. They created the planet. Astrael spun, each face taking turns contributing to the worlds creation.
 - [[#Oblivion]] wept, creating the sea and the seeds of aquatic life.
 - [[#Aegis]] strikes with their shield, raising mountains and shaping the continents
 - [[#Seraphina]] wove the sky an atmosphere together. Binding all.
As they spun faster, the world took shape but, the processes was so intense that it split them apart. While separated, they each continued to build upon their creation. [[#Aegis]] created the races of the world, the energy gave them life. He watched their creatures grow and thrive, they became protective, overprotective even. [[#Oblivion]] gathered the residual magic from their split. [[#Seraphina]] took the magic and wove it into a blanket. All three draped it over the planet.

### Aegis
#### The Everlasting Sentinel rules over protection, preservation, guardianship of knowledge. 

Symbols: Shield, silver light, the full moon
Worshippers: Guardians, scholars, those seeking protection or preservation of knowledge
Relationship to mortals: Aegis is viewed as a protector and is often called upon in times of danger. They are known to sometimes intervene directly in mortal affairs, particularly when ancient knowledge or the races they created are threatened. However, this intervention can sometimes be heavy-handed or misguided.
Connection to the moon: Aegis is tied to the largest of the three moons, often called the Sentinel's Eye. This moon appears silver and seems to have a faint, shield-like pattern on its surface when viewed closely. During the full phase of this moon, Aegis's power is at its peak, and protective magic is strongest.
Interesting aspect: Despite creating the races, Aegis doesn't always understand them fully. This can lead to well-intentioned but sometimes misguided actions on their part, adding depth to their character and potential conflict in your story.
