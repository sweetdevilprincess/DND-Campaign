Horns have grown from the Weaver's empty eye sockets, a testament to her pact with the Whispering Vale.  The Weaver, a figure of great mystery and power, presides over a loom that appears to be woven from strands of pure magic. Those who seek her aid, whether it be for healing, divination, or the strengthening of their own magical abilities, must be willing to pay a heavy price - a piece of their very being, whether it be a memory, an emotion, or even a fragment of their soul.
