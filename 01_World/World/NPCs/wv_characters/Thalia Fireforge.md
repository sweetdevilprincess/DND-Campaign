## Background

> Thalia comes from a long line of skilled gnome alchemists. Her family's workshop was her playground from an early age, fueling her fascination with alchemy. Over the years, her curiosity led her to study under renowned alchemists, gathering knowledge on exotic ingredients across the realms. She eventually returned to her homeland, eager to share her discoveries with her community.

## Description

> Thalia is a spirited and lively gnome with fiery red hair that seems to dance with every step. Her emerald green eyes are full of curiosity and intellect. She stands at 2 ½ feet tall, often dressed in a practical but stylish alchemist's robe with pockets full of treasured vials and ingredients. Her cheerful nature and passion for alchemy make her a favorite among her customers and peers alike.

## Story Involvement

She frequently collaborates with local healers and adventurers, providing potions and magical aid. Recently, [[Darrow]] gifted her two valuable books from the [[Sunspire Citadel#Helios Enlightenment]], which deepened her trust in him and led her to share a [[Worn Journal]] and potions of greater healing in gratitude.

## Additional Notes
