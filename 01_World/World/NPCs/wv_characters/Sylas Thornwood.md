- **Stories**
	- The Moonlit Wanderer: In the stillness of the moonlight, deep within the [[Whispering Vale]] there once roamed a mysterious figure known as the moonlight wanderer. Clocked in shadows and adorned with silver armorh. He was said to be a guardian of forgotten knowledge and ancient wisdom. Tales tell of him appearing to lost souls, guiding them through the misty forest to the hidden portals that led them to other realms. Many say he is but a  ghostly apparition, while others believe he is an immortal being who traverses the [[Whispering Vale]] in search of those in need. To this day his presence can still be felt when the moons, gentle light bathes the glen, and traveler swear they catch glimpses of his shimmering figure silently watching over them.
	- Legend of the Lost Kingdom: Deep within the ethereal veil, shrouded in the mystical marshlands, lies [[Etherium]], lost to time, and now only whispered in folktales. It was once a thriving kingdom, ruled by a council of a sages communicated closely with the gods. It is said that within the city‘s ancient walls, were untold secrets of forgotten magic. However, great calamity befell the city, causing it to vanish into the veiled missed, leaving nothing but haunting echoes behind. Some believe Etherium still exists, hidden in an alternate realm. Others believe the city rose into the sky and became Atheria. Many adventurers have set out to find Etherium, but none have returned to tell the tale. Nonetheless, hope persists, and the legend of the lost kingdom continues to inspire daring souls seeking the truth. 
	- The Blight‘s Betrayal: In the ancient days of the [[Whispering Vale]], when the drakes and the dryads roamed freely, when [[Atheria]] was newly risen, ushering in a new era of enchantment, and wonders beyond imagination. However, unforeseen consequences emerged, plunging the Vale into a steep decline. Witnessing the suffering caused by the decaying world, a mysterious being only known as Mistress Elysia, bestowed the [Blight](Diseases.md#Blight) upon the dryads and the drakes, hoping to alleviate the devastation. The blight was a blessing. It’s potent essence imbued with the power to rejuvenate the world, and breathe life into the dead and decaying. The Drakes and Dryades reveled in their newfound ability to heal the land as vibrant flora sprung forth wherever they walked, thriving with renewed vitality. The blight was perceived as a sacred gift from their mistress and the drinks and dryads became the caretakers of the veil, nurturing its bountiful, beauty. As time passed their mistresses presents began to wane, and eventually disappeared without a trace, leaving the drakes and dryads to grapple with the implication of [[Atheria]] ‘s rise. In their unwavering faith they continue to utilize the blight to heal unaware the gift had been tainted in their mistresses absence. The blight which once brought life now sowed death, twisting the once benevolent flora and consuming all in its path. Too late, the creatures realized the blight had become an uncontrollable force, thriving on corruption. With the last of their power, the Drakes and dryads contained the blight within a small area. To this date, the Vale bares, the scars of the blight betrayal. The origins of the gift remain lost. It is uncertain whether the blight was genuinely a gift or a test of the resilience and devotion. The Vale stands as a testament to the delicate balance between life and death. We’re seeds of hope and despair are intertwined in an eternal dance. Despite the devastation, the creatures are still hopeful for their mistresses return, and hold onto the belief that someone may one day help remove the blight from themselves.
	- The Fathomless Depths: Beyond the shimmering surface of the [[Verida]] lies a realm unknown to the most- The Abyssal Trenches. Here beneath the ocean‘s embrace, ancient merfolk guardians stand watch over the mysterious ruins of an underwater kingdom called Luminara. Whispers tell of a powerful artifact hidden within these submerged walls-a Gem known as the Sea‘s Heart. It is said that this gem harness is the energy of the ocean‘s depths, and those who possess it can control the tides and weather, but the guardians are fiercely protective, and only a chosen few who have the seas blessing can venture into the abyssal trenches to seek to see this heart. Many have tried, and many have failed, but the legend endures luring adventures with its promise of untold power.

## Elementals 
"Long ago, when the world was young and magic flowed like rivers through the land, the Elementals danced. Oh, not like you or I might dance at a tavern after too much ale - no, no! They danced the very rhythm of creation itself. Each had their role, their purpose, their sacred duty given to them by the god of creation itself, Astrael."

Fire's Elemental's crystal heart, giving light to the region. The thick fog of the Vale as Earth's breath, it's very soul that keeps us safe. Water's cruel dark maw, ready to take. Tales of Aetheria, carried down to us on Air's whispered breath.

Atop this task they were each given another, to protect their anchors. Overtime these anchors were harmed, they became corrupted. And so a grand council was formed. A speaker for each region and an acting guardian, each bound to the land through their anchors and their duty. Their power being the only thing keeping these anchors tied to the very fabric of magic that blankets our world.
