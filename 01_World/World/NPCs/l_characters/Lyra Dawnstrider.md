While employed there [[Astrael]] kept urging her on and finally told her that [[Etherium]] was ready to be unearthed again. 


she is the headmistress at the school. Later in the campaign the Aasimar will brand her as a traitor and go after her. She is working toward keeping the knowledge of Etherium alive.
