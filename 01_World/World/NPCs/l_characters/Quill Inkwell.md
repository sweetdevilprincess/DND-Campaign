A male kenku that was very close to [[Eldrin]] before his passing. [[Eldrin]] had mentioned that he had adopted [[Stella]] and had opened up about how guilty he felt about being unable to save [[Valentine]] from his fate with his daughter [[Avanna]]. He told Quill that he hoped [[Valentine]] and [[Stella]] would find each other and find their way here. He instructed Quill to give them something.
