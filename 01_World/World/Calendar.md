The year has 320 days, 12 months. 8 of the months have 32 days 4 have 16. The months that are 16 are often full of festivals welcoming/biding farewell to the seasons.
There is a magical cycle within the world. The cycle is 322 days long, with 240 days of the magic actin as it should and 82 days where the magic is being "repaired". While it is being repaired, the magic acts abnormal.

## Season In depth

### Winter 80 days


I want to try to keep what I have, at least the idea of it, but also have it realistic. Would you also be to help me create a table to use for DND for the seasons? I feel like just a fairly simple one for each region, for each season. This would be something like during the first month in the season, each day I would roll to see the weather, but it would get progressively more intense, for the most part.

For example, in the winter the first week is relatively cold, not much happening, I roll and a snowstorm hits and, in season drops the temp 2 degrees Fahrenheit. The next day starts 2 degrees lower. A few days later, it could be a nice sunny day, and the temp raises 1 degree for the season. Does that make sense?

If it would make it easier, I am happy to do one season or region at a time.
