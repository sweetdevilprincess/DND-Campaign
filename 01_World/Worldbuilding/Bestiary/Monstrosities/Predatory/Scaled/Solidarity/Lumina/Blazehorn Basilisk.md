A multi-legged, reptilian horror with fiery scales and glowing red eyes. [[Sunfire Crystal]] s protrude outwards from it's body, they glow with the beasts inner fire.  Its deadly gaze transforms victims into obsidian with veins of ember. With its strong jaws, the creature will shatter and consume the stone, which returns to organic form in its gullet. This breed of Basilisk is found in the [[Ember Caverns]] and [[Emberfall Gorge]]. They have developed an immunity to fire and the ability to cause fire damage due to consuming large amounts of [[Sunfire Crystal]] s in their raw form. Additionally, they are able to exhale a cone of sulfuric, acidic breath, a byproduct of their volcanic habitat.
