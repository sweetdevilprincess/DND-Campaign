These Drakes are quite a bit smaller than others and are able to reproduce organically. These stunted dragons possess iridescent scales that shimmer in various colors. Dazzlewings Drakes are highly agile and have a mesmerizing ability to emit dazzling bursts of light, which they use to disorient and confuse their adversaries.
