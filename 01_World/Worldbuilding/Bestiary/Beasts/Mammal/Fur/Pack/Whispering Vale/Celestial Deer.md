## Celestial Stag
Celestial Stags are majestic creatures with  shimmering, silvery-white antlers that seem to be made of crystalized starlight. *When found at night they seem to have Northern Lights following them from their antlers* They possess the ability to channel celestial energy, creating a protective barrier and guiding lost wanderers to safety. These barriers glimmer and shine with lights from their antlers. It also seems to send any travelers to another realm to keep them safe. 
*Beloved by the Gods*: When a stag is killed, the deity that created it curses the creature that dealt the killing blow. The cursed creature finds the natural world working against them. Roots randomly rise up to trip the creature when it walks past a tree (5% chance per mile traveled in forest terrain). Animals are more reluctant to obey (disadvantage on [[Animal Handling]] checks). The wind seems to always be blowing in the least favorable direction for the creature (scattering papers, sending the creatures scent towards creatures tracking it, etc.) The curse lasts until lifted by a [[remove curse]] spell or after the cursed creature completes a task for the deity or its temple. Players will begin to get glimpses of their, and their parties deaths at every turn. *When cursed in combat will occasionally watch a party member be slain when they are not.*
*Divine Messengers*. When pious elves die and their spirits journey to the Outer Planes, some are accorded the honor of spending a year and a day serving the elven gods as a white stag before moving on to enjoy the afterlife. A deity will dispatch a white stag to the Material Plane when it wants to send a group of mortals on a divine quest, or it needs to give them a nudge in the right direction. *When travelers look too deeply into a stag, they will see the elf within. **Roll Investigation or Animal Handling** When speaking with travelers their voices are a cacophony of all the elves they were before.*
