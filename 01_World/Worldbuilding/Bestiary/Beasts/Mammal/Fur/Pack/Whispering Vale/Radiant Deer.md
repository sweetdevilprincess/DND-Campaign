## Radiant Stag
Creature with shimmering, golden antlers. 
Radiant stags are considered good omens, especially when seen in regions other than [[Lumina]]. 
*Forest Chase*: These stags will often lead adventurers on a chase through the forest through a number of obstacles, if the adventurers can keep up and not lose sight of the stag they are likely to find a useful clue or item. Sometimes the pursuers may experience a vision as well as seeing other people chasing the stag *These other chasers are people who have gone after the stag before, players cannot interact with them but these images can try to harm the players*
*Dying Curse*: A radiant stag always runs when attacked. If cornered, it defends itself to the best of its ability. Killing a radiant stag angers the gods who created it. When the stag dies, its body vanishes in a puff of golden smoke, and the person who slew the creature is subject to a curse that can only be removed with magic or by performing a quest on behalf of the gods- sometimes both. If not removed the one who dealt the final blow begins to painfully change into a new stag over the course of 2 d 12 days. The final stage they lose all memories of their past life and gain the memories of the stag.
*Mystical Favor*: If you come upon an injured radiant stag and are able to heal it and/or care for it. The stag will allow you to collect it's tears, which can be used to reincarnate a slain creature within 24 hrs after the death. However the creatures alignment is changed to be within 2 blocks of the stag's. When crying, players within a 10 ft radius hear the cries of souls that have refused to help and have slain the creature in past lives.
