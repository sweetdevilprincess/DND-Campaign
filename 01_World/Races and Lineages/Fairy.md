## History & Origins
> [!history]
> Ancient lore speaks of the First Queen, once the smallest of her kind, who transformed not out of love but sacrifice - a desperate desire to protect her kin from greater predators. This maternal instinct became twisted through generations, with Queens preserving their children's wings even as they consume their essence.
>
> Each Queen maintains a collection of preserved fairy wings, arranged chronologically like a mother's cherished memories, telling stories of entire fairy generations preserved in crystalline cases or woven into haunting tapestries.
